# 1823. Find the Winner of the Circular Game

# There are `n` friends playing a game where they sit in a clockwise circle and are numbered from `1` to `n`.
# Starting at the `1st` friend, count the next `k` friends (wrapping around if necessary), and the last counted friend
# leaves the circle.
# Repeat until one friend remains, who is the winner.
# Given `n` and `k`, return the winner.
