    "**Understanding the Core Idea**\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea is to use binary numbers to represent subsets. Here's how:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Number of Subsets:** A list of length `n` has `2^n` possible subsets.  This is because each element can either be in the subset (1) or not (0).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Binary Representation:** Consider a binary number with `n` digits. Each digit corresponds to an element in the list.\n",
    "   * If a digit is '1,' the corresponding element is included in the subset.\n",
    "   * If a digit is '0,' the element is excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "   For example, if `nums = [1, 2, 3]`:\n",
    "   * `000` represents the empty subset []\n",
    "   * `001` represents [3]\n",
    "   * `010` represents [2]\n",
    "   * `100` represents [1]\n",
    "   * ... and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Walkthrough**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `1 << n`:  This calculates 2 raised to the power of `n`, which gives the total number of possible subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `for i in range(1 << n):` This loop iterates over all possible binary numbers from 0 to $2^n – 1$, effectively generating all subset representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `for j in range(n):`: This inner loop examines each bit position (0 to n-1) in the current binary number `i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `if i & (1 << j):`: This is the key bit manipulation part. It does the following:\n",
    "   * `1 << j`: Shifts the number 1 left by `j` positions. This creates a binary number with a '1' only at the `j`th position.\n",
    "   * `i & (1 << j)`: Performs a bitwise AND. The result is non-zero if and only if the `j`th bit of `i` is also 1. This tells us whether the `j`th element of `nums` should be included in the current subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `xor ^= nums[j]`: If the element is included, it's XORed into the running `xor` total for this subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `ans += xor`: After processing a subset, its XOR total is added to the final `ans`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take `nums = [5, 1, 6]`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Subsets: [], [6], [1], [1, 6], [5], [5, 6], [5, 1], [5, 1, 6]\n",
    "2. Binary representations: 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111\n",

    "**Understanding the Core Idea:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution leverages two key insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bitwise OR Accumulation:** By iteratively performing a bitwise OR (`|`) operation on all numbers in the list, we create a single value (`combined_bits`) where each bit position is set to '1' if *at least one* of the input numbers had a '1' in that position.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Contribution of Set Bits:**  Consider a bit position that is set to '1' in the `combined_bits` value. This means that at least one number in the original list had a '1' in that position. Now, let's think about the subsets of the list. Half of the subsets will include that number (and hence that '1' bit), while the other half will not.  \n",
    "\n",
    "   In the subsets where that '1' bit is present, it will contribute to the XOR total. In the subsets where it's absent, it won't. This means that *each set bit contributes its value to exactly half of the subsets*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Breakdown:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`combined_bits = 0`:** Initialize a variable to store the result of the bitwise OR accumulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`for num in nums:`:** Iterate over each number `num` in the input list.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`combined_bits |= num`:** Perform a bitwise OR between the current `combined_bits` value and the number `num`. This updates `combined_bits` so that any bit set to '1' in `num` will also be set to '1' in `combined_bits`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`return combined_bits * (1 << (len(nums) - 1))`:**\n",
    "   - `(1 << (len(nums) - 1))`: Calculates 2 raised to the power of (n-1), where n is the length of the list. This represents the number of subsets each element appears in (half of the total subsets).\n",
    "   - `combined_bits * ...`:  Multiplies the `combined_bits` value by this factor. Since `combined_bits` represents the sum of all the unique bits that are set across the numbers, multiplying it by the number of subsets each bit contributes to give us the total sum of XOR totals over all subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say `nums = [5, 1, 6]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Binary Representations:**\n",
    "    - 5:  0101\n",
    "    - 1:  0001\n",
    "    - 6:  0110\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Bitwise OR Accumulation:**\n",
    "    - `combined_bits = 0 | 0101 = 0101`\n",
    "    - `combined_bits = 0101 | 0001 = 0101`\n",
    "    - `combined_bits = 0101 | 0110 = 0111`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The final `combined_bits` is 0111 (decimal 7).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Calculation:**\n",
    "    - Number of subsets per element: 2^(3-1) = 4\n",
    "    - Sum of XOR totals: 7 * 4 = 28\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficiency:** This approach is computationally efficient as it avoids iterating over all possible subsets and performing explicit XOR calculations.\n",
    "- **Correctness:** This solution is guaranteed to produce the correct result for any non-negative integer list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The time complexity is O(n) as the algorithm iterates through the input list once to calculate the bitwise OR of all numbers.\n",
    "- This is significantly more efficient than the O(2^n * n) complexity of the brute-force approach.\n",

    "The core idea of backtracking is to explore all possible solutions by building them incrementally and then undoing (backtracking) choices that don't lead to valid solutions. In this context:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each decision is whether to include or exclude the current element in the subset being constructed.\n",
    "- We systematically make these choices for each element, building subsets recursively.\n",
    "- When we reach a point where we've considered all elements, we've found a complete subset.\n",
    "- We then backtrack by removing the last element and trying the next choice for the previous element.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Walkthrough:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Outer Function (`subsets2`):**\n",
    "   - Takes the input list `nums`.\n",
    "   - Initializes an empty list `ans` to store the resulting subsets.\n",
    "   - Calls the inner `backtrack` function to start the recursive process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inner Function (`backtrack`):**\n",
    "   - Takes two arguments:\n",
    "      - `start`: The index of the element we're currently considering.\n",
    "      - `current_subset`: The subset being built so far.\n",
    "   - **Base Case:** If `start` reaches the end of the `nums` list, it means we've considered all elements and have a complete subset.  In this case, we make a copy of `current_subset` and append it to the `ans` list. This copy is important because `current_subset` is modified during the backtracking process.\n",
    "   - **Recursive Case:**\n",
    "     - Iterate from `start` to the end of `nums`:\n",
    "       - Add the current element (`nums[i]`) to the `current_subset`.\n",
    "       - Recursively call `backtrack(i + 1, current_subset)` to explore the next element and its choices.\n",
    "       - After the recursive call returns, remove the last element (`current_subset.pop()`) to backtrack and try the next choice (excluding the current element).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Initial Call (`backtrack(0, [])`):**\n",
    "   - Starts the backtracking process from the first element (index 0) with an empty subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider `nums = [1, 2, 3]`. The backtracking process would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "                                   []\n",

    "                        [1]                  [] \n",
    "                      /      \\             /    \\\n",
    "                     /        \\           /      \\\n",
    "                  [1,2]       [1]       [2]       []\n",

    "           [1,2,3]   [1,2] [1,3] [1] [2,3] [2] [3]   []  (leaf nodes are the subsets)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The recursive function `backtrack` is called $2^n$ times, where n is the length of the input list.\n",
    "- In each call, we make a copy of the current subset, which takes O(n) time.\n",
    "- Therefore, the overall time complexity is $O(2^n \\cdot n)$.\n",

    "- The space complexity is $O(2^n \\cdot n)$ to store all the generated subsets.\n",
    "- The recursive stack can go as deep as the number of elements in the input list (n). Hence, the space complexity is also $O(n)$ for the recursive stack."
