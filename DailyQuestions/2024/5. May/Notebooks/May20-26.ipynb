    "**Understanding the Core Idea**\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea is to use binary numbers to represent subsets. Here's how:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Number of Subsets:** A list of length `n` has `2^n` possible subsets.  This is because each element can either be in the subset (1) or not (0).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Binary Representation:** Consider a binary number with `n` digits. Each digit corresponds to an element in the list.\n",
    "   * If a digit is '1,' the corresponding element is included in the subset.\n",
    "   * If a digit is '0,' the element is excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "   For example, if `nums = [1, 2, 3]`:\n",
    "   * `000` represents the empty subset []\n",
    "   * `001` represents [3]\n",
    "   * `010` represents [2]\n",
    "   * `100` represents [1]\n",
    "   * ... and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Walkthrough**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `1 << n`:  This calculates 2 raised to the power of `n`, which gives the total number of possible subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `for i in range(1 << n):` This loop iterates over all possible binary numbers from 0 to $2^n – 1$, effectively generating all subset representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `for j in range(n):`: This inner loop examines each bit position (0 to n-1) in the current binary number `i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `if i & (1 << j):`: This is the key bit manipulation part. It does the following:\n",
    "   * `1 << j`: Shifts the number 1 left by `j` positions. This creates a binary number with a '1' only at the `j`th position.\n",
    "   * `i & (1 << j)`: Performs a bitwise AND. The result is non-zero if and only if the `j`th bit of `i` is also 1. This tells us whether the `j`th element of `nums` should be included in the current subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `xor ^= nums[j]`: If the element is included, it's XORed into the running `xor` total for this subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `ans += xor`: After processing a subset, its XOR total is added to the final `ans`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "Absolutely! Here's the \"Example\" subsection you could add to your coding notes, focused on the bit manipulation approach for the XOR subset problem:\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Understanding Bit Representation:**\n",
    "   - The code generates all possible subsets by iterating through the numbers 0 to `2^n - 1` (where `n` is the length of `nums`).\n",
    "   - Each number represents a unique subset based on its binary representation:\n",
    "      - `000` = Empty set\n",
    "      - `001` = {5}\n",
    "      - `010` = {1} \n",

    "2. **Iteration and XOR Calculation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Iteration 0 (Bit Representation = 000):**\n",
    "      - All elements are skipped because none are included in the subset.\n",
    "      - XOR total: 0 (XOR of an empty set is always 0).\n",

    "      - Only the second element (1) is included.\n",

    "   - **Iteration 3 (Bit Representation = 011):**\n",
    "      - Both 5 and 1 are included.\n",
    "      - XOR total: 5 ^ 1 = 4\n",
    "   - **Iteration 4 (Bit Representation = 100):**\n",
    "      - Only the third element (6) is included.\n",

    "**Understanding the Core Idea:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution leverages two key insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bitwise OR Accumulation:** By iteratively performing a bitwise OR (`|`) operation on all numbers in the list, we create a single value (`combined_bits`) where each bit position is set to '1' if *at least one* of the input numbers had a '1' in that position.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Contribution of Set Bits:**  Consider a bit position that is set to '1' in the `combined_bits` value. This means that at least one number in the original list had a '1' in that position. Now, let's think about the subsets of the list. Half of the subsets will include that number (and hence that '1' bit), while the other half will not.  \n",
    "\n",
    "   In the subsets where that '1' bit is present, it will contribute to the XOR total. In the subsets where it's absent, it won't. This means that *each set bit contributes its value to exactly half of the subsets*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Breakdown:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`combined_bits = 0`:** Initialize a variable to store the result of the bitwise OR accumulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`for num in nums:`:** Iterate over each number `num` in the input list.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`combined_bits |= num`:** Perform a bitwise OR between the current `combined_bits` value and the number `num`. This updates `combined_bits` so that any bit set to '1' in `num` will also be set to '1' in `combined_bits`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`return combined_bits * (1 << (len(nums) - 1))`:**\n",
    "   - `(1 << (len(nums) - 1))`: Calculates 2 raised to the power of (n-1), where n is the length of the list. This represents the number of subsets each element appears in (half of the total subsets).\n",
    "   - `combined_bits * ...`:  Multiplies the `combined_bits` value by this factor. Since `combined_bits` represents the sum of all the unique bits that are set across the numbers, multiplying it by the number of subsets each bit contributes to give us the total sum of XOR totals over all subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Absolutely! Here's the \"Example\" subsection tailored to the bitwise OR accumulation approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input:** We'll use the same input array as before: `nums = [5, 1, 6]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - `combined_bits` starts at 0. This variable will store the bitwise OR of all numbers in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bitwise OR Accumulation:**\n",
    "   - **Iteration 1:**\n",
    "      - `num = 5` (binary: `00000101`)\n",
    "      - `combined_bits` becomes `00000101` (5 OR 0 = 5)\n",
    "   - **Iteration 2:**\n",
    "      - `num = 1` (binary: `00000001`)\n",
    "      - `combined_bits` becomes `00000101` (5 OR 1 = 5) \n",
    "   - **Iteration 3:**\n",
    "      - `num = 6` (binary: `00000110`)\n",
    "      - `combined_bits` becomes `00000111` (5 OR 6 = 7)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Combined Bits Analysis:**\n",
    "   - The final value of `combined_bits` is 7 (binary: `00000111`).\n",
    "   - Observe:\n",
    "      - The first bit is '1' because at least one number in the array has a '1' in that position.\n",
    "      - The second bit is '1' for the same reason.\n",
    "      - The third bit is '1' because both 6 and 7 have a '1' in that position.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculating the Sum:**\n",
    "   - **Logic:** The final sum of XOR totals is calculated as `combined_bits * (1 << (n - 1))`.\n",
    "   - **Explanation:**\n",
    "      - For every bit position that is set to 1 in `combined_bits`, half of the subsets will have a '1' in that position and the other half will have a 0.\n",
    "      - This means that for each set bit, half of the subsets will contribute to the XOR sum (when XORed with 0, the result is the same as the original bit).\n",
    "      - Since there are `2^(n-1)` subsets for each number, and we have `n` numbers, we multiply the number of subsets with the set bits in the combined_bits value to find the total XOR sum.\n",
    "   - **Calculation:**\n",
    "      - `combined_bits = 7` (decimal)\n",
    "      - `n = 3` (length of `nums`)\n",
    "      - `1 << (n - 1) = 1 << 2 = 4`\n",
    "      - `result = 7 * 4 = 28`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bitwise OR:** This approach cleverly leverages the bitwise OR operation to combine information about all elements in the array.\n",
    "- **Set Bits:** The set bits in the `combined_bits` variable directly indicate which bit positions contribute to the final XOR sum.\n",
    "- **Efficient Calculation:** This method avoids explicitly generating all subsets, leading to a linear time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The time complexity is O(n) as the algorithm iterates through the input list once to calculate the bitwise OR of all numbers.\n",

    "This solution, like the previous `subsetXORSum` variations, cleverly uses binary numbers to represent subsets. Here's the core idea:\n",

    "1. **Binary Representation of Subsets:** For a list of length `n`, each of the 2^n possible subsets can be represented by a unique binary number with `n` bits.\n",
    "   * A '1' bit at position `j` means the element at index `j` in the original list is included in the subset.\n",
    "   * A '0' bit at position `j` means the element is excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generating Subsets:** By iterating through all binary numbers from 0 to $2^n–1$, we effectively generate all possible bit combinations, and thus, all possible subsets.\n",

    "**Code Breakdown:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`n = len(nums)`:** Get the length of the input list to determine the number of bits needed to represent the subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`ans = []`:** Initialize an empty list to store the generated subsets.\n",

    "4. **`subset = []`:**  Initialize an empty list to store the elements of the current subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`for j in range(n):`:** This inner loop iterates through each bit position (0 to n-1) in the current binary number `i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **`if i & (1 << j):`:**\n",
    "   - `(1 << j)`: Creates a mask where only the j-th bit is set to 1.\n",
    "   - `i & (1 << j)`: Performs a bitwise AND to check if the j-th bit of `i` is also 1. If it is, it means the element at index `j` in the original list should be included in the current subset.\n",

    "**Understanding the Core Idea:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach aims to optimize the pure backtracking solution by precomputing which substrings of the input string are palindromes. This precomputation is done using dynamic programming, which avoids redundant calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Breakdown:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Programming Table (`dp_table`) Initialization:**\n",
    "   - `n = len(s)`: Store the length of the input string.\n",
    "   - `dp_table = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]`: Create a 2D table (n x n) where `dp_table[i][j]` is `True` if the substring `s[i:j+1]` is a palindrome, and `False` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dynamic Programming Table Filling:**\n",
    "   - `for start in range(n - 1, -1, -1):`: Iterate over possible starting positions of palindromes in reverse order.\n",
    "   - `for end in range(start, n):`: Iterate over possible ending positions for each starting position.\n",
    "   - **Palindrome Check and DP Update:**\n",
    "     - `if s[start] == s[end] and (end - start < 2 or dp_table[start + 1][end - 1]):`\n",
    "       - A substring is a palindrome if:\n",
    "         - The start and end characters match (`s[start] == s[end]`).\n",
    "         - AND either:\n",
    "           - The substring is of length 1 or 2 (`end - start < 2`).\n",
    "           - OR the substring without its first and last characters is a palindrome (`dp_table[start + 1][end - 1]`).\n",
    "     - If the condition is met, set `dp_table[start][end] = True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Backtracking Function `backtrack(start, current_partition)`:**\n",
    "   - This function is almost the same as in the pure backtracking solution, but with a key optimization:\n",
    "     - Instead of calling `is_palindrome(s, start, end)`, it directly checks `dp_table[start][end]` to see if the substring is a palindrome. This avoids redundant palindrome checks and significantly speeds up the process.\n",

    "4. **Main Function (`partition2`):** \n",

    "         - Return from this recursive call.\n",
    "       - Backtrack: Remove 'b' from `current_partition`.\n",

    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optimization:** The DP table helps avoid redundant palindrome checks, making the backtracking process more efficient.\n",

    "**Understanding the Core Idea:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea leverages these insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Remainder Groups:** Integers that leave the same remainder when divided by `k` cannot be in the same beautiful subset.  This is because their difference would be a multiple of `k`. Therefore, we group numbers based on their remainders modulo `k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Recursive Counting with Memoization:** For each remainder group, we recursively count beautiful subsets. Memoization is used to store and reuse results of subproblems, avoiding redundant computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dynamic Programming Principle:** The number of beautiful subsets for a group depends on the choices made for previous numbers in the same remainder group. This is the essence of dynamic programming – breaking down a problem into smaller overlapping subproblems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Walkthrough**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - `total_count = 1`: Starts with 1 to account for the empty subset (which is always beautiful).\n",
    "   - `remainder_groups`:  A dictionary to group numbers by their remainders when divided by `k`.  Each remainder will be a key, and the value will be another dictionary counting the occurrences of each number within that remainder group.\n",
    "   - `memo`: A dictionary to store memoized results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`count_beautiful_subsets(subsets, current_index)`:** Recursive function:\n",
    "   - **Base Case:** If `current_index` reaches the end of the `subsets` list, we have a complete subset. Since the empty subset is beautiful, we return 1.\n",
    "   - **Memoization Check:**\n",
    "      - Create a key for memoization based on the current index and the remaining subsets (converted to a tuple for hashability).\n",
    "      - If the key exists in the `memo` dictionary, return the cached result to avoid recomputing.\n",
    "   - **Divide and Conquer:**\n",
    "      - `exclude_count`: Count of beautiful subsets if we exclude the current number (recurse with `current_index + 1`).\n",
    "      - `include_count`: Count of beautiful subsets if we include the current number.\n",
    "         - Start with `(1 << subsets[current_index][1]) - 1`: This calculates 2 raised to the power of the count of the current number, minus 1. It represents the number of ways to include some or all occurrences of the current number.\n",
    "         - **Key Logic:**\n",
    "           - If the next number in the group is `k` away from the current number, it *must* be in a different subset, so we multiply `include_count` by the result of recursing with `current_index + 2` (skipping the next number).\n",
    "           - Otherwise, the next number *can* be in the same subset, so we multiply by the result of recursing with `current_index + 1`.\n",
    "   - **Memoization Update:**\n",
    "      - Calculate the total count for this subproblem (`exclude_count + include_count`).\n",
    "      - Store the result in `memo` for future reference.\n",
    "      - Return the total count.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Grouping by Remainders:**\n",
    "   - `for num in nums`: Iterates through each number in the input list.\n",
    "   - `remainder_groups[num % k][num] += 1`:  Increments the count of the number `num` in the dictionary corresponding to its remainder modulo `k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculating for Each Group:**\n",
    "   - `for group in remainder_groups.values()`: Iterates through each remainder group.\n",
    "   - `sorted_subsets = sorted(group.items())`: Sorts the numbers in the group.\n",
    "   - `total_count *= count_beautiful_subsets(sorted_subsets, 0)`: Multiplies the overall `total_count` by the number of beautiful subsets within this group.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Final Result:**\n",
    "   - `return total_count - 1`: Subtracts 1 to exclude the empty subset, as the problem asks for non-empty beautiful subsets.\n",

    "\n",
    "This approach builds on the previous dynamic programming solution but uses an iterative method to count beautiful subsets. The key steps include:\n",

    "1. **Grouping:** Numbers are grouped based on their remainders when divided by `k`. Numbers within the same group cannot be in the same beautiful subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterative DP:** For each group, the algorithm iteratively calculates the number of beautiful subsets considering each number and its frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **State Tracking:** Two variables (`count_excluding_prev` and `exclude_count`) track the counts of beautiful subsets that exclude and include the previous number, respectively. These counts are updated dynamically as we iterate through the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Combining Groups:** The final count of beautiful subsets is the product of the counts from each remainder group, excluding the empty subset.\n",

    "**Code Walkthrough**\n",
    "\n",

    "   - Similar to the previous approach, we iterate through `nums` and group the numbers based on their remainders modulo `k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Iterative Calculation for Each Group:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `for group in remainder_groups.values()`: Iterates through each remainder group.\n",
    "   - `prev_num = -k`:  Initializes a variable to track the previous number in the sorted group. Starts with `-k` to ensure the first number is not considered `k` away from the previous.\n",
    "   - `count_excluding_prev, exclude_count = 1, 1`: Initializes counts for subsets excluding and including the previous number. Both of them start at 1 to account for the possibility of having no elements from the current group in a subset.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Iterating over Sorted Numbers:**\n",
    "      - `for num, frequency in sorted(group.items())`: Iterates over the numbers in the group in sorted order, along with their frequencies.\n",
    "      - `include_count = (1 << frequency) - 1`: Calculates the number of ways to include some or all occurrences of the current number `num`.  This is 2 raised to the power of `frequency` (representing all possible combinations), minus 1 to exclude the case where none of the occurrences are included.\n",
    "      - **Key Logic (DP State Transition):**\n",

    "      - **Updating Counts:**\n",
    "        - `count_excluding_prev, exclude_count = exclude_count, exclude_count + include_count`:  Update the count variables for the next iteration. \n",

    "   - After processing all groups, we multiply `beautiful_count` by the `exclude_count` for the last group. This incorporates all the beautiful subsets from all groups.\n",

    "**Understanding the Core Idea**\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem aims to find the highest possible score by forming words from a given set of letters. Each letter has a corresponding score. The challenge is to select the optimal combination of words that doesn't reuse any letter more than once, and that yields the maximum total score.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution employs a **backtracking** strategy. Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, and removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Walkthrough**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function `maxScoreWords1`:**\n",
    "   - Takes three arguments:\n",
    "     - `words`: A list of words (strings).\n",
    "     - `letters`: A list of available letters (strings).\n",
    "     - `score`: A list of scores corresponding to each letter of the alphabet.\n",
    "   - Initializes `max_score` to 0.\n",
    "   - Calculates `letter_counts`, a list storing the frequency of each letter in the `letters` list.\n",
    "   - Calls the `backtrack` function to start the recursive process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Function `backtrack` (Recursive Function):**\n",
    "   - Takes three arguments:\n",
    "     - `start`: The index of the word to consider (starting from 0).\n",
    "     - `current_score`: The total score of the words selected so far.\n",
    "     - `letter_counts`: A list keeping track of the remaining available letters.\n",
    "   - Base Case:\n",
    "     - If all words have been considered (i.e., `start` is equal to the length of `words`), update `max_score` if the `current_score` is higher.\n",
    "   - Recursive Case:\n",
    "     - Iterate through the words from the `start` index onwards:\n",
    "       - Get the current word (`word`).\n",
    "       - Calculate the `word_score` and check if it's valid (i.e., if there are enough letters to form the word).\n",
    "       - If the word is valid:\n",
    "         - Decrement the `letter_counts` for each letter used in the word.\n",
    "         - Recursively call `backtrack` to consider the next word, passing in:\n",
    "           - `i + 1` (the next word's index)\n",
    "           - `current_score + word_score` (the updated score)\n",
    "           - the modified `letter_counts`\n",
    "         - Restore the `letter_counts` by incrementing the letter counts that were decremented.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Result:**\n",
    "   - The function returns the `max_score`, which is the highest achievable score across all valid combinations of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** words = [\"dog\",\"cat\",\"dad\",\"good\"], letters = [\"a\",\"a\",\"c\",\"d\",\"d\",\"d\",\"g\",\"o\",\"o\"], score = [1,0,9,5,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `max_score` starts at 0.\n",
    "   - `letter_counts` is computed as `[2, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, ...]` (representing the frequency of each letter in 'letters').\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Backtracking:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **`backtrack(0, 0, letter_counts)`:** (Start with the first word and a score of 0)\n",
    "     - Consider \"dog\":\n",
    "       - Valid? Yes, enough letters.\n",
    "       - Update `letter_counts`: `[1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, ...]`\n",
    "       - Recurse: `backtrack(1, 8, updated_letter_counts)`  (Score of 'dog' is 8)\n",
    "     - Consider \"cat\":\n",
    "       - Valid? Yes, enough letters.\n",
    "       - Update `letter_counts`: `[1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, ...]`\n",
    "       - Recurse: `backtrack(2, 17, updated_letter_counts)` (Score of 'dog'+'cat' is 17)\n",
    "     - ... and so on.\n",
    "     - Since this is the starting point, all words are explored from here.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **`backtrack(1, 8, letter_counts)`:** (Start with the second word, having already used \"dog\")\n",
    "     - Consider \"cat\":\n",
    "       - Valid? Yes, enough letters.\n",
    "       - ...\n",
    "     - Consider \"dad\":\n",
    "       - Valid? Yes, enough letters.\n",
    "       - ...\n",
    "     - ...and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - This continues recursively, exploring all possible combinations of words. At each step, if a word is invalid due to insufficient letters, the recursion backtracks and tries the next word.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Key Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The recursion builds up potential solutions incrementally.\n",
    "   - When a valid word is added, the `current_score` is increased, and the `letter_counts` are updated.\n",
    "   - If the `current_score` at any point exceeds the current `max_score`, `max_score` is updated.\n",
    "   - After a word is processed (whether valid or not), the `letter_counts` are restored to their previous state before trying the next word. This is the essence of backtracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Example Branch (One Possible Path):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Start: `backtrack(0, 0, letter_counts)`\n",
    "   2. Choose \"dog\"\n",
    "   3. Choose \"dad\"\n",
    "   4. Choose \"good\" (Not valid due to insufficient 'o's)\n",
    "   5. Backtrack, remove \"good\"\n",
    "   6. No more valid words for this path, so the current score for this branch is 18.\n",
    "   7. Backtrack further, exploring other branches...\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Final Result:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The algorithm explores all possible paths, keeping track of the highest `max_score` achieved.\n",
    "   - In this example, the highest score is 23 (by forming \"dad\" and \"good\").\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Note:**\n",
    "    - This backtracking approach is comprehensive but can be computationally expensive for large input sizes due to its exponential nature. The second approach (with memoization) optimizes this by avoiding redundant calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The time complexity of this solution is $O(2^n * L)$, where:\n",
    "  - $n$ is the number of words in the list.\n",
    "  - $L$ is the average length of the words in the input list.\n",
    "- The backtracking algorithm explores all possible combinations of words, and for each combination, it checks if the word can be formed using the available letters. This process has a time complexity of $O(2^n)$. The additional factor of $L$ accounts for the time taken to process each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Space Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The recursive stack space for the backtracking function is $O(n)$.\n",
    "- The overall space complexity is $O(n)$."

    "       - After the recursion returns for a given `word_index`, the `max_scores_by_word_idx[word_index]` is updated with the maximum score achieved starting from that word.  For example, `max_scores_by_word_idx[0]` will store the maximum score achievable when starting with the word \"dog.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Backtracking (Starting with other word indices):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The process repeats for starting words \"cat,\" \"dad,\" and \"good.\"\n",
    "   - Each starting word triggers a new backtracking exploration, and the maximum scores for each starting word are stored in `max_scores_by_word_idx`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Finding Overall Maximum:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Finally, the algorithm goes through `max_scores_by_word_idx` and finds the highest value, which represents the maximum score achievable across all valid word combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memoization's Role:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Consider a scenario where, starting from \"dog,\" the algorithm finds that adding \"cat\" and then \"dad\" leads to a valid combination with a score of 22.\n",
    "    - Later, when starting from \"cat,\" the algorithm will encounter the same combination (\"cat\" then \"dad\") again.\n",
    "    - However, because this combination's maximum score (22) is already memoized in `max_scores_by_word_idx[1]`, it won't recompute the score, saving time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Final Result:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The algorithm returns the overall maximum score, which is 23 in this example (achieved by forming \"dad\" and \"good\").\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memoization:** The `max_scores_by_word_idx` array stores maximum scores for each starting word, avoiding redundant calculations.\n",
    "- **Bitmask:** The `used_words_bitmask` efficiently tracks which words are already included in a combination, preventing redundant explorations.\n",
    "- **Early Termination:** It checks early if a word cannot be formed or a combination is invalid, saving computation time.\n",
    "- **Precalculation:** Precalculating `word_scores` and `available_letter_counts` improves efficiency by avoiding repeated calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The time complexity is $O(2^n * L)$, where:\n",
    "  - $n$ is the number of words in the list.\n",
    "  - $L$ is the average length of the words in the input list.\n",
    "- The backtracking algorithm explores all possible combinations of words, and for each combination, it checks if the word can be formed using the available letters. This process has a time complexity of $O(2^n)$.\n",
    "- The additional factor of $L$ accounts for the time taken to process each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Space Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The overall space complexity is $O(n)$.\n",
    "- The memoization array `max_scores_by_word_idx` and the `visited_states` set contribute to the space complexity."

    "**Understanding the Core Idea**\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem at hand involves finding all possible ways to split a given string (`s`) into valid words using a provided dictionary (`wordDict`). The key idea is to use a recursive backtracking approach with memoization to explore all potential combinations efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memoization:** Significantly improves performance by avoiding redundant calculations for the same substring starting positions.\n",
    "- **Backtracking:** The core algorithm that systematically explores all possible segmentations by making choices and undoing them when they don't lead to valid solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Walkthrough**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Main Function `wordBreak1(s, word_dict)`:**\n",
    "   - Initializes a memoization dictionary (`memo`) to store results for previously computed substrings.\n",
    "   - Calls the `backtrack` function to start the process from the beginning of the string.\n",
    "   - Converts the returned list of word lists into a list of space-separated sentences and returns the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Backtracking Function `backtrack(start)`:**\n",
    "   - **Base Case:** If the `start` index reaches the end of the string, it means a valid segmentation has been found, and an empty list representing a sentence is returned.\n",
    "   - **Memoization:** If the result for the current `start` index is already stored in `memo`, it's directly returned to avoid redundant computations.\n",
    "   - **Recursive Exploration:**\n",
    "     - Iterates over possible ending indices (`end`) for substrings starting from the `start` index.\n",
    "     - Extracts the substring `word` from `start` to `end`.\n",
    "     - Checks if `word` exists in the `word_dict`.\n",
    "     - If found, recursively calls `backtrack(end)` to explore further segmentations.\n",
    "     - The results from the recursive calls are appended to the current `word`, forming potential sentences.\n",
    "   - **Memoization Update:** Stores the generated sentences in `memo` for future use.\n",
    "   - Returns the list of sentences found.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Result Processing:**\n",
    "    - The function converts the list of word lists into a list of space-separated sentences.\n",
    "    - The final result is a list of all possible valid sentences formed by splitting the input string.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** s = \"catsanddog\", wordDict = [\"cat\",\"cats\",\"and\",\"sand\",\"dog\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `s` is \"catsanddog\" and `wordDict` is [\"cat\",\"cats\",\"and\",\"sand\",\"dog\"].\n",
    "   - `memo` is an empty dictionary.\n",

    "2. **Backtracking (Starting with index 0: \"c\"):**\n",

    "     - **First level:**\n",
    "       - Try to add \"cat,\" \"cats\" (one at a time).\n",
    "       - For example, when trying to add \"cat\":\n",
    "         - `current_score` becomes \"cat\".\n",
    "         - The recursion continues with `backtrack(3)`.\n",
    "     - **Deeper levels:**\n",
    "       - The recursion explores further combinations, but now it avoids redundant calculations.\n",
    "       - If it encounters a state (combination of words and remaining letters) that has been seen before (stored in `memo`), it doesn't explore it again.\n",
    "     - **Memoization:**\n",
    "       - After the recursion returns for a given `start` index, the `memo[start]` is updated with the maximum score achieved starting from that word.  For example, `memo[0]` will store the maximum score achievable when starting with the word \"cat.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Backtracking (Continuing with other indices):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The process repeats for starting words \"a,\" \"t,\" \"s,\" \"a,\" \"n,\" \"d,\" \"d,\" \"o,\" \"g.\"\n",
    "   - Each starting word triggers a new backtracking exploration, and the maximum scores for each starting word are stored in `memo`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Final Result:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The algorithm returns the overall maximum score, which is [\"cats and dog\", \"cat sand dog\"] in this example.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Space Complexity:** \n",

The Trie allows quick determination of whether a substring is a prefix of a valid word, while dynamic programming avoids recomputing results for the same substrings.\n",

    "- **Trie Data Structure:** A tree-like data structure that stores a dynamic set of strings, making prefix searches efficient.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Programming:** The iterative approach builds up sentences from the end of the string, using the Trie to identify valid words.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Walkthrough**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TrieNode Class:**\n",
    "   - Defines a node in the Trie structure.\n",
    "   - `children`: A dictionary to store child nodes, where keys are characters and values are the corresponding child nodes.\n",
    "   - `is_word_end`: A boolean flag to indicate if the node marks the end of a valid word.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`build_trie(words)` Function:**\n",
    "   - Constructs a Trie from the given list of words (`word_dict`).\n",
    "   - Iterates through each word:\n",
    "     - Starts at the root of the Trie.\n",
    "     - Traverse each character in the word, adding new nodes to the Trie if necessary.\n",
    "     - Sets `is_word_end` to `True` for the last node of the word.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Main Function `wordBreak3(s, word_dict)`:**\n",
    "   - Initializes a DP table `sentences_at_index`, where `sentences_at_index[i]` stores a list of sentences found starting at index `i`.\n",
    "   - Builds the Trie from `word_dict`.\n",
    "   - Iterates backward through the string (`start` from `n-1` to 0).\n",
    "     - For each `start`:\n",
    "       - Traverses the Trie, following the characters of the substring from `start`.\n",
    "       - If the traversal reaches a node that marks the end of a word (`is_word_end` is True), it means a valid word is found.\n",
    "       - The word found at the current `end` index is added to all the sentences stored in `sentences_at_index[end+1]`, creating new sentences that can be formed starting from the `start` index.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Result:**\n",
    "   - Returns the space-separated sentences stored in `sentences_at_index[0]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** s = \"catsanddog\", wordDict = [\"cat\",\"cats\",\"and\",\"sand\",\"dog\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `s` is \"catsanddog\" and `wordDict` is [\"cat\",\"cats\",\"and\",\"sand\",\"dog\"].\n",
    "   - `sentences_at_index` is initialized as `[[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [[]]]` (11 empty lists for a string of length 10 plus one for the base case).\n",
    "   - A Trie is built from `wordDict`, with each node representing a character and the `is_word_end` flag indicating the end of a valid word.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterative Dynamic Programming:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The algorithm starts from the end of the string and moves backward.\n",
    "   - For `start = 9` (the last character \"g\"), there are no valid words in the dictionary that start with \"g,\" so `sentences_at_index[9]` remains an empty list.\n",
    "   - For `start = 8` (the second last character \"o\"), the algorithm finds the word \"dog\" in the Trie. Since `sentences_at_index[11]` (the end of the string) contains an empty list (representing a valid sentence), \"dog\" is added to `sentences_at_index[8]`. Now, `sentences_at_index` looks like this: `[[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [[\"dog\"]], [], [[]]]`.\n",
    "   - The process continues backward. For `start = 7` (\"d\"), the algorithm finds \"dog\" and \"and\" in the Trie. It adds these words to the sentences found in `sentences_at_index[10]` and `sentences_at_index[11]`, respectively. Now, `sentences_at_index` looks like this: `[[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [[\"and\", \"dog\"]], [[\"dog\"]], [], [[]]]`.\n",
    "   - The process continues until `start = 0`. At this point, the algorithm finds \"cat\" and \"cats\" in the Trie. It adds these words to the sentences found in `sentences_at_index[3]` and `sentences_at_index[4]`, respectively. Now, `sentences_at_index` looks like this: `[[[\"cat\", \"sand\", \"dog\"], [\"cats\", \"and\", \"dog\"]], [], [], [[\"sand\", \"dog\"]], [[\"and\", \"dog\"]], [], [], [[\"and\", \"dog\"]], [[\"dog\"]], [], [[]]]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Final Result:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The algorithm returns the sentences found at the start of the string (`sentences_at_index[0]`), which are [\"cat sand dog\", \"cats and dog\"].\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The time complexity is $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the length of the input string. The algorithm iterates through the string, considering all possible substrings starting from each index.\n",
    "- The Trie structure allows efficient prefix lookups, enhancing the overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Space Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The space complexity is $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the length of the input string.\n",
    "- The DP table `sentences_at_index` stores the sentences that can be formed starting from each index, leading to a quadratic space complexity.\n",
    "- The Trie structure also contributes to the space complexity, but the overall space usage is reasonable for practical input sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparison with Other Approaches**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Improved Time Complexity:** The use of Trie optimizes the search for valid words within substrings compared to directly checking the dictionary in previous approaches.\n",
    "- **Space Trade-Off:** The Trie data structure introduces additional space complexity. However, it significantly speeds up the prefix search, leading to better overall performance in many cases."

    "The problem asks us to find the total number of valid attendance records of length `n`, considering two constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. No more than one absence (`A`).\n",
    "2. No more than two consecutive late (`L`) days.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea is to use a recursive top-down dynamic programming approach with memoization. We break down the problem into smaller subproblems, where each subproblem represents finding the number of valid records starting from a specific day, given the current number of absences and consecutive late days. Memoization is used to store and reuse the results of these subproblems, avoiding redundant calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Walkthrough**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`checkRecord1(n)` Function:**\n",
    "   - Initializes a memoization dictionary (`memo`) to store results.\n",
    "   - Defines a constant `MOD` for modulo operations to prevent integer overflow.\n",
    "   - Calls the `count_valid_records` function to start the process from the first day.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`count_valid_records(day, absences, consecutive_late_days)` Function:**\n",
    "   - **Base Case:** If `day == n`, it means we have reached the end of the record, and there's only one valid way to complete it (no more characters to add). So, it returns 1.\n",
    "   - **Memoization:** If the result for the current state (`day`, `absences`, `consecutive_late_days`) is already in `memo`, it returns the stored result.\n",
    "   - **Recursive Cases:**\n",
    "     - **Case 1: Absent:** If the number of absences (`absences`) is less than 1, we can add an 'A'. It recursively calls `count_valid_records` with the next day, one more absence, and resets `consecutive_late_days` to 0.\n",
    "     - **Case 2: Late:** If the number of consecutive late days (`consecutive_late_days`) is less than 2, we can add an 'L'. It recursively calls `count_valid_records` with the next day, the same number of absences, and one more consecutive late day.\n",
    "     - **Case 3: Present:** We can always add a 'P'. It recursively calls `count_valid_records` with the next day and the same number of absences, resetting `consecutive_late_days` to 0.\n",
    "   - **Modulo & Memoization:** The results from each case are added together (modulo `MOD`). The final result is stored in `memo` and returned.\n",
    "   \n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Exploring Absence (Day 1):**\n",
    "   - Assuming an absence on day 0, we move to day 1 with one absence.\n",
    "   - Again, we explore all possibilities (being late, being present).\n",
    "   - Reaching day 2, we hit a base case (end of the record) for both branches, adding 1 to the total valid records each time (1 for being late + 1 for being present = 2).\n",
    "   - This result is memoized: `(1, 1, 0): 2`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Exploring Lateness (Day 1):**\n",
    "   - Returning to day 0, we explore the option of being late.\n",
    "   - Moving to day 1, we have zero absences and one consecutive late day.\n",
    "   - Again, we explore all possibilities, reaching base cases on day 2, adding 3 to the total valid records (1 for being absent + 1 for being late + 1 for being present = 3).\n",

    "\n",
    "4. **Exploring Being Present (Day 1):**\n",

    "   - Moving to day 1, we have zero absences and zero consecutive late days (same as the starting state, but memoization hasn't been done for this level yet).\n",
    "   - This leads to the same subproblems as step 1, adding another three valid records.\n",
    "   - This result is memoized: `(1, 0, 0): 3`.\n",

    "\n",

    "   - After processing all days, `dp_current_state` holds the final counts for the last day. The total number of valid records is calculated by summing up all values in `dp_current_state` (modulo `MOD`).\n",
    "   \n",
    "**Example:** n = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input:** We start with an input of `n = 2`, aiming to find valid attendance records for a 2-day period.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization (Day 0):**\n",
    "   - We initialize the `dp_current_state` with the base case: one valid empty record (`[1, 0, 0]` for no absences, no late days), and zeros elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Day 1:**\n",
    "   - **Current State:** `[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]` (one valid record with no absences or late days).\n",
    "   - **For each state (absences, consecutive_late_days):**\n",
    "      - We calculate the next day's possible states by adding 'P' (present) to all valid records. This updates `dp_next_state[0][0]` to 1.\n",
    "      - If no prior absences, we can add 'A' (absent), updating `dp_next_state[1][0]` to 1.\n",
    "      - If fewer than two consecutive late days, we can add 'L' (late), updating `dp_next_state[0][1]` to 1.\n",
    "   - **After updating all states:** `dp_next_state` is `[[1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0]]`.\n",
    "   - **Preparing for Day 2:** We swap `dp_current_state` and `dp_next_state`, then reset `dp_next_state` to zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Day 2:**\n",
    "   - **Current State:** `[[1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0]]` (valid records from day 1).\n",
    "   - **For each state (absences, consecutive_late_days):**\n",
    "      - We repeat the same process as day 1, adding 'P,' 'A' (if allowed), and 'L' (if allowed) to each state.\n",
    "      - Note that some calculations build on previous values. For example, `dp_next_state[0][1]` (no absences, 1 late day) becomes 2 because it accumulates the previous value (1) plus the new valid records formed by adding 'P' to states `[0, 0]` and `[0, 1]`.\n",
    "   - **After updating all states:** `dp_next_state` is `[[2, 1, 1], [3, 1, 0]]`.\n",
    "   - **No Day 3:**  Since `n = 2`, we stop here.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Final Result:**\n",
    "   - The final `dp_current_state` is `[[2, 1, 1], [3, 1, 0]]`. \n",
    "   - We sum all values in this table (2 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 0 = 8) to get the total number of valid attendance records.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bottom-Up:** We build the solution from smaller subproblems (earlier days) towards the final solution (day `n`).\n",
    "- **Tabulation:** We use tables (`dp_current_state`, `dp_next_state`) to store and reuse intermediate results.\n",
    "- **State Representation:** Each cell in the table represents a unique state defined by the day, number of absences, and consecutive late days.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The time complexity is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the attendance record.\n",
    "- The algorithm iterates through each day, considering all possible states (absences and consecutive late days) for each day.\n",
    "- The iterative approach efficiently computes the number of valid records without redundant calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Space Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The space complexity is $O(1)$.\n",
    "- The solution uses a fixed-size 2D array for the DP table, regardless of the length of the attendance record.\n",
    "- The iterative approach optimizes space usage compared to recursive solutions that rely on the call stack."

    "**Understanding the Core Idea**\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach leverages the power of matrix operations to calculate the number of valid attendance records efficiently. The key idea is to represent the problem as a series of state transitions, where each state represents a combination of absences and consecutive late days. We can then construct a transition matrix that captures how the number of valid records changes from one day to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Walkthrough**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - `MOD` is defined for modulo operations to prevent overflow.\n",
    "   - `transition_matrix` is a 6x6 matrix that defines how many ways you can move from one state to another by adding a 'P,' 'A,' or 'L.' Each row and column represents one of the six possible states:\n",
    "     - (0, 0): No absences, no late days\n",
    "     - (0, 1): No absences, 1 late day\n",
    "     - (0, 2): No absences, 2 consecutive late days\n",
    "     - (1, 0): 1 absence, no late days\n",
    "     - (1, 1): 1 absence, 1 late day\n",
    "     - (1, 2): 1 absence, 2 consecutive late days\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`matrix_multiply(matrix1, matrix2)` Function:**\n",
    "   - Performs matrix multiplication modulo `MOD` to ensure that the values stay within the specified range.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`matrix_power(matrix, power)` Function:**\n",
    "   - Calculate the matrix exponentiation of a matrix using a recursive approach.\n",
    "   - Use the property that $M^n$ = $( M^{n/2} )^2$ if $n$ is even and $M^n = M \\times M^{n-1}$ if $n$ is odd.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Main Function `checkRecord3(n)`:**\n",
    "   - Calculates the matrix power of the `transition_matrix` raised to `n` using the `matrix_power` function.\n",
    "   - The first row of the resulting matrix represents the number of valid records ending in each of the six states.\n",
    "   - The total number of valid records is the sum of the values in the first row, modulo `MOD`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** n = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input:** We start with an input of `n = 2`, aiming to find valid attendance records for a 2-day period.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Transition Matrix:**\n",
    "   - We define a 6x6 `transition_matrix` where each row/column represents a state (absences, consecutive late days). \n",
    "   - The value at `[i][j]` indicates the number of ways to transition from state `i` to state `j` in one day. \n",
    "   - For example, `[0][1]` is 1, meaning we can transition from state (0, 0) to state (0, 1) in one way (by being late).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculating Matrix Power:**\n",
    "   - **Goal:** Raise the transition matrix to the power of `n` (2 in this case).\n",
    "   - **`matrix_power(transition_matrix, 2)`:**\n",
    "      - Since the power (2) is even, we recursively calculate `matrix_power(transition_matrix, 1)`.\n",
    "      - **Base Case:** `matrix_power(transition_matrix, 1)` returns the original `transition_matrix`.\n",
    "      - We square the base case matrix using `matrix_multiply`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Matrix Multiplication:**\n",
    "   - **Inputs:** The original `transition_matrix` is multiplied by itself.\n",
    "   - **Process:** The algorithm performs matrix multiplication, where each element in the result matrix represents the number of ways to reach a state from the initial state (0, 0) in TWO steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Result Matrix:**\n",
    "   - The resulting matrix is:\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "       [[2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0],\n",
    "        [2, 1, 0, 3, 1, 0],\n",
    "        [1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0],\n",
    "        [0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1],\n",
    "        [0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0],\n",
    "        [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]]\n",
    "       ``` \n",
    "   - **Interpretation:**\n",
    "      - The element at `[0][0]` (2) means there are two ways to reach state (0, 0) in two days (PP, LP).\n",
    "      - Similarly, `[0][1]` (1) means there's one way to reach state (0, 1) (PL).\n",
    "      - The first row `[2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0]` represents the number of valid attendance records ending in each respective state after two days.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Final Calculation:**\n",
    "   - We sum the values in the first row of the result matrix (`2 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 0 = 8`) to get the total number of valid attendance records.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Matrix Representation:** The transition matrix elegantly encodes the rules of the problem.\n",
    "- **State Transitions:** Matrix exponentiation models the cumulative effect of state transitions over multiple days.\n",
    "- **Logarithmic Time:** This approach is significantly faster than dynamic programming for large values of `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The time complexity is $O(\\log n)$, where $n$ is the length of the attendance record.\n",
    "- The matrix exponentiation technique allows us to calculate the number of valid records efficiently.\n",
    "- The recursive matrix power function reduces the number of multiplications needed to compute the result.\n",
    "- The overall time complexity is significantly better than the linear approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Space Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The space complexity is $O(1)$.\n",
    "- The solution uses a fixed-size transition matrix (6x6) and intermediate matrices for matrix multiplication.\n",
    "- The space usage remains constant regardless of the length of the attendance record."
