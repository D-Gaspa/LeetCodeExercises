    "**Understanding the Core Idea**\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea is to use binary numbers to represent subsets. Here's how:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Number of Subsets:** A list of length `n` has `2^n` possible subsets.  This is because each element can either be in the subset (1) or not (0).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Binary Representation:** Consider a binary number with `n` digits. Each digit corresponds to an element in the list.\n",
    "   * If a digit is '1,' the corresponding element is included in the subset.\n",
    "   * If a digit is '0,' the element is excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "   For example, if `nums = [1, 2, 3]`:\n",
    "   * `000` represents the empty subset []\n",
    "   * `001` represents [3]\n",
    "   * `010` represents [2]\n",
    "   * `100` represents [1]\n",
    "   * ... and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Walkthrough**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `1 << n`:  This calculates 2 raised to the power of `n`, which gives the total number of possible subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `for i in range(1 << n):` This loop iterates over all possible binary numbers from 0 to $2^n â€“ 1$, effectively generating all subset representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `for j in range(n):`: This inner loop examines each bit position (0 to n-1) in the current binary number `i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `if i & (1 << j):`: This is the key bit manipulation part. It does the following:\n",
    "   * `1 << j`: Shifts the number 1 left by `j` positions. This creates a binary number with a '1' only at the `j`th position.\n",
    "   * `i & (1 << j)`: Performs a bitwise AND. The result is non-zero if and only if the `j`th bit of `i` is also 1. This tells us whether the `j`th element of `nums` should be included in the current subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `xor ^= nums[j]`: If the element is included, it's XORed into the running `xor` total for this subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `ans += xor`: After processing a subset, its XOR total is added to the final `ans`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take `nums = [5, 1, 6]`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Subsets: [], [6], [1], [1, 6], [5], [5, 6], [5, 1], [5, 1, 6]\n",
    "2. Binary representations: 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111\n",

    "**Understanding the Core Idea:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution leverages two key insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bitwise OR Accumulation:** By iteratively performing a bitwise OR (`|`) operation on all numbers in the list, we create a single value (`combined_bits`) where each bit position is set to '1' if *at least one* of the input numbers had a '1' in that position.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Contribution of Set Bits:**  Consider a bit position that is set to '1' in the `combined_bits` value. This means that at least one number in the original list had a '1' in that position. Now, let's think about the subsets of the list. Half of the subsets will include that number (and hence that '1' bit), while the other half will not.  \n",
    "\n",
    "   In the subsets where that '1' bit is present, it will contribute to the XOR total. In the subsets where it's absent, it won't. This means that *each set bit contributes its value to exactly half of the subsets*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Breakdown:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`combined_bits = 0`:** Initialize a variable to store the result of the bitwise OR accumulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`for num in nums:`:** Iterate over each number `num` in the input list.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`combined_bits |= num`:** Perform a bitwise OR between the current `combined_bits` value and the number `num`. This updates `combined_bits` so that any bit set to '1' in `num` will also be set to '1' in `combined_bits`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`return combined_bits * (1 << (len(nums) - 1))`:**\n",
    "   - `(1 << (len(nums) - 1))`: Calculates 2 raised to the power of (n-1), where n is the length of the list. This represents the number of subsets each element appears in (half of the total subsets).\n",
    "   - `combined_bits * ...`:  Multiplies the `combined_bits` value by this factor. Since `combined_bits` represents the sum of all the unique bits that are set across the numbers, multiplying it by the number of subsets each bit contributes to give us the total sum of XOR totals over all subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say `nums = [5, 1, 6]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Binary Representations:**\n",
    "    - 5:  0101\n",
    "    - 1:  0001\n",
    "    - 6:  0110\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Bitwise OR Accumulation:**\n",
    "    - `combined_bits = 0 | 0101 = 0101`\n",
    "    - `combined_bits = 0101 | 0001 = 0101`\n",
    "    - `combined_bits = 0101 | 0110 = 0111`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The final `combined_bits` is 0111 (decimal 7).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Calculation:**\n",
    "    - Number of subsets per element: 2^(3-1) = 4\n",
    "    - Sum of XOR totals: 7 * 4 = 28\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficiency:** This approach is computationally efficient as it avoids iterating over all possible subsets and performing explicit XOR calculations.\n",
    "- **Correctness:** This solution is guaranteed to produce the correct result for any non-negative integer list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The time complexity is O(n) as the algorithm iterates through the input list once to calculate the bitwise OR of all numbers.\n",
    "- This is significantly more efficient than the O(2^n * n) complexity of the brute-force approach.\n",

    "The core idea of backtracking is to explore all possible solutions by building them incrementally and then undoing (backtracking) choices that don't lead to valid solutions. In this context:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each decision is whether to include or exclude the current element in the subset being constructed.\n",
    "- We systematically make these choices for each element, building subsets recursively.\n",
    "- When we reach a point where we've considered all elements, we've found a complete subset.\n",
    "- We then backtrack by removing the last element and trying the next choice for the previous element.\n",

    "**Code Walkthrough:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Outer Function (`subsets2`):**\n",
    "   - Takes the input list `nums`.\n",

    "   - **Base Case:** If `start` reaches the end of the `nums` list, it means we've considered all elements and have a complete subset.  In this case, we make a copy of `current_subset` and append it to the `ans` list. This copy is important because `current_subset` is modified during the backtracking process.\n",
    "   - **Recursive Case:**\n",
    "     - Iterate from `start` to the end of `nums`:\n",
    "       - Add the current element (`nums[i]`) to the `current_subset`.\n",
    "       - Recursively call `backtrack(i + 1, current_subset)` to explore the next element and its choices.\n",
    "       - After the recursive call returns, remove the last element (`current_subset.pop()`) to backtrack and try the next choice (excluding the current element).\n",

    "**Understanding the Core Idea:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea leverages these insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Remainder Groups:** Integers that leave the same remainder when divided by `k` cannot be in the same beautiful subset.  This is because their difference would be a multiple of `k`. Therefore, we group numbers based on their remainders modulo `k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Recursive Counting with Memoization:** For each remainder group, we recursively count beautiful subsets. Memoization is used to store and reuse results of subproblems, avoiding redundant computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dynamic Programming Principle:** The number of beautiful subsets for a group depends on the choices made for previous numbers in the same remainder group. This is the essence of dynamic programming â€“ breaking down a problem into smaller overlapping subproblems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Walkthrough**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - `total_count = 1`: Starts with 1 to account for the empty subset (which is always beautiful).\n",
    "   - `remainder_groups`:  A dictionary to group numbers by their remainders when divided by `k`.  Each remainder will be a key, and the value will be another dictionary counting the occurrences of each number within that remainder group.\n",
    "   - `memo`: A dictionary to store memoized results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`count_beautiful_subsets(subsets, current_index)`:** Recursive function:\n",
    "   - **Base Case:** If `current_index` reaches the end of the `subsets` list, we have a complete subset. Since the empty subset is beautiful, we return 1.\n",
    "   - **Memoization Check:**\n",
    "      - Create a key for memoization based on the current index and the remaining subsets (converted to a tuple for hashability).\n",
    "      - If the key exists in the `memo` dictionary, return the cached result to avoid recomputing.\n",
    "   - **Divide and Conquer:**\n",
    "      - `exclude_count`: Count of beautiful subsets if we exclude the current number (recurse with `current_index + 1`).\n",
    "      - `include_count`: Count of beautiful subsets if we include the current number.\n",
    "         - Start with `(1 << subsets[current_index][1]) - 1`: This calculates 2 raised to the power of the count of the current number, minus 1. It represents the number of ways to include some or all occurrences of the current number.\n",
    "         - **Key Logic:**\n",
    "           - If the next number in the group is `k` away from the current number, it *must* be in a different subset, so we multiply `include_count` by the result of recursing with `current_index + 2` (skipping the next number).\n",
    "           - Otherwise, the next number *can* be in the same subset, so we multiply by the result of recursing with `current_index + 1`.\n",
    "   - **Memoization Update:**\n",
    "      - Calculate the total count for this subproblem (`exclude_count + include_count`).\n",
    "      - Store the result in `memo` for future reference.\n",
    "      - Return the total count.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Grouping by Remainders:**\n",
    "   - `for num in nums`: Iterates through each number in the input list.\n",
    "   - `remainder_groups[num % k][num] += 1`:  Increments the count of the number `num` in the dictionary corresponding to its remainder modulo `k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculating for Each Group:**\n",

    "**Understanding the Core Idea:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach builds on the previous dynamic programming solution but uses an iterative method to count beautiful subsets. The key steps include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Grouping:** Numbers are grouped based on their remainders when divided by `k`. Numbers within the same group cannot be in the same beautiful subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterative DP:** For each group, the algorithm iteratively calculates the number of beautiful subsets considering each number and its frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **State Tracking:** Two variables (`count_excluding_prev` and `exclude_count`) track the counts of beautiful subsets that exclude and include the previous number, respectively. These counts are updated dynamically as we iterate through the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Combining Groups:** The final count of beautiful subsets is the product of the counts from each remainder group, excluding the empty subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Walkthrough**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `beautiful_count = 1`:  Starts with 1 to account for the empty subset (always beautiful).\n",
    "   - `remainder_groups`:  A dictionary to group numbers by remainders when divided by `k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Grouping by Remainders:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Similar to the previous approach, we iterate through `nums` and group the numbers based on their remainders modulo `k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Iterative Calculation for Each Group:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `for group in remainder_groups.values()`: Iterates through each remainder group.\n",
    "   - `prev_num = -k`:  Initializes a variable to track the previous number in the sorted group. Starts with `-k` to ensure the first number is not considered `k` away from the previous.\n",
    "   - `count_excluding_prev, exclude_count = 1, 1`: Initializes counts for subsets excluding and including the previous number. Both of them start at 1 to account for the possibility of having no elements from the current group in a subset.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Iterating over Sorted Numbers:**\n",
    "      - `for num, frequency in sorted(group.items())`: Iterates over the numbers in the group in sorted order, along with their frequencies.\n",
    "      - `include_count = (1 << frequency) - 1`: Calculates the number of ways to include some or all occurrences of the current number `num`.  This is 2 raised to the power of `frequency` (representing all possible combinations), minus 1 to exclude the case where none of the occurrences are included.\n",
    "      - **Key Logic (DP State Transition):**\n",
    "        - `if num - prev_num == k`:  If the difference between the current and previous numbers is exactly `k`, they cannot be in the same subset.\n",
    "           - In this case, we multiply `include_count` by `count_excluding_prev`, which represents the number of beautiful subsets that excluded the previous number.\n",
    "        - `else`: If the difference is not `k`, the current number can be combined with previous elements.\n",
    "           - In this case, we multiply `include_count` by `exclude_count`, which represents the number of beautiful subsets up to this point.\n",
    "      - **Updating Counts:**\n",
    "        - `count_excluding_prev, exclude_count = exclude_count, exclude_count + include_count`:  Update the count variables for the next iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Final Result:**\n",
    "   - After processing all groups, we multiply `beautiful_count` by the `exclude_count` for the last group. This incorporates all the beautiful subsets from all groups.\n",
    "   - We then subtract 1 to remove the empty subset, as the problem asks for non-empty beautiful subsets.\n",
