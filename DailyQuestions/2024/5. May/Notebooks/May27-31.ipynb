    "The problem is essentially about finding the longest possible contiguous segment (substring) within a string `s` that can be transformed into the corresponding segment of another string `t`. The catch is that each character transformation has a cost, and you have a limited total budget (`max_cost`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The code solves this using a **sliding window** technique. Imagine a window that slides along the strings.  The window represents the current substring being considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The window starts small and expands to the right.\n",
    "2. The cost of transforming the characters within the window is tracked.\n",
    "3. If the cost exceeds the budget, the window's left side is moved to the right to shrink it until the cost fits the budget again.\n",
    "4. Throughout this process, the maximum length of a valid substring (one that fits the budget) is recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Walkthrough**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculate Costs:**\n",
    "   - `cost` is a list where each element represents the cost of transforming the character at index `i` in `s` to the corresponding character in `t`.\n",
    "   - The `ord` function gets the ASCII value of a character, and the absolute difference gives the transformation cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sliding Window:**\n",
    "   - `start_index` and `end_index` define the boundaries of the window.\n",
    "   - `total_cost` keeps track of the cumulative cost within the window.\n",
    "   - `max_length` stores the longest valid substring found so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Expanding the Window:**\n",
    "   - The `for` loop iterates through each character, effectively moving `end_index` to expand the window to the right.\n",
    "   - The cost of the new character is added to `total_cost`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Shrinking the Window (if necessary):**\n",
    "   - The `while` loop checks if `total_cost` exceeds the budget.\n",
    "   - If it does, the window shrinks from the left by:\n",
    "      - Removing the cost of the leftmost character (`cost[start_index]`).\n",
    "      - Incrementing `start_index`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Update Max Length:**\n",
    "   - After each iteration, the `max_length` is updated if the current window represents a longer valid substring than any previously seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Return Result:**\n",
    "   - Finally, the function returns `max_length`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input:**\n",
    "    - `s = \"abcd\"`\n",
    "    - `t = \"bcdf\"`\n",
    "    - `max_cost = 3`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Walkthrough:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Initialization:**\n",
    "    - The code first prints the input parameters for easy reference.\n",
    "    - The length of the strings `n` is calculated as 4.\n",
    "    - The `cost` array is computed, containing the absolute differences between the character codes of the corresponding characters in `s` and `t`: `[1, 1, 1, 2]`.\n",
    "    - `start_index` is set to 0, `total_cost` is initialized to 0, and `max_length` is set to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Sliding Window Iterations:**\n",
    "    - A loop iterates through each `end_index` from 0 to 3 (the length of the strings).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Iteration 1 (`end_index = 0`):**\n",
    "        -    The cost at `end_index = 0` (which is 1) is added to `total_cost`.\n",
    "        -    The current substrings are `\"a\"` and `\"b\"`.\n",
    "        -    Since `total_cost` (1) is less than or equal to `max_cost` (3), the window doesn't shrink, and `max_length` is updated to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Iteration 2 (`end_index = 1`):**\n",
    "        -    The cost at `end_index = 1` (which is 1) is added to `total_cost`, making it 2.\n",
    "        -    The current substrings become `\"ab\"` and `\"bc\"`.\n",
    "        -    Again, `total_cost` (2) is less than or equal to `max_cost` (3), so the window doesn't shrink, and `max_length` is updated to 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Iteration 3 (`end_index = 2`):**\n",
    "        -    The cost at `end_index = 2` (1) is added to `total_cost`, bringing it to 3.\n",
    "        -    The substrings are now `\"abc\"` and `\"bcd\"`.\n",
    "        -    `total_cost` (3) is still within the budget, so `max_length` becomes 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Iteration 4 (`end_index = 3`):**\n",
    "        -    The cost at `end_index = 3` (2) is added, increasing `total_cost` to 5.\n",
    "        -    The substrings are `\"abcd\"` and `\"bcdf\"`.\n",
    "        -    Now, `total_cost` (5) exceeds `max_cost` (3), triggering the `while` loop.\n",
    "        -    The loop shrinks the window from the left (increases `start_index`) until `total_cost` falls within the budget.\n",
    "        -    This results in a final substring pair of `\"cd\"` and `\"df\"` with a `total_cost` of 3.\n",
    "        -    Since the window shrank, `max_length` remains at its previous value of 3.\n",

    "2. **Division by 2 in Binary:** Dividing a binary number by 2 is the same as shifting all its bits one position to the right. For example, `110` (6 in decimal) divided by 2 is `11` (3 in decimal).\n",
    "3. **Adding 1 to an Odd Binary Number:** Adding 1 to an odd binary number often results in simply flipping the last '1' to a '0'. For example, `101` (5 in decimal) plus 1 is `110` (6 in decimal).\n",

    "**Understanding the Core Idea**\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach also simulates the reduction process, but it does so by processing the bits of the binary number in reverse order (from the most significant bit to the least significant bit). It focuses on how carries propagate when adding 1 to odd numbers. The core idea is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Carry Propagation:** When adding 1 to an odd number in binary, a carry might be generated, which needs to be propagated to the next higher bit position. \n",
    "2. **Reverse Processing:** By starting from the second-to-last bit (most significant) and moving towards the first bit (least significant), we can efficiently handle carry propagation and count the steps accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Walkthrough**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization (`steps = 0`, `carry = 0`)**: Initialize `steps` to count the operations, and `carry` to track if there's a carry-over from the previous bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterate Over Bits (`for index in range(len(s) - 1, 0, -1)`)**:\n",
    "    - The loop starts from the second-to-last bit (`len(s) - 1`) to the first bit (`0`) in reverse order.\n",
    "    - We skip the very last bit (`index = 0`) because it doesn't affect carry propagation when adding 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Count Steps (`steps += 1`)**: Each bit operation (division or addition) requires a step, so we increment `steps` for every bit processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handle Odd Number (`if s[index] == '1'`)**:\n",
    "    - If the current bit is '1' (odd number):\n",
    "       - Check for existing carry (`if carry == 0`)\n",
    "           - If there's no carry, adding 1 will create a carry (`carry = 1`)\n",
    "           - This carry propagation requires an extra step (`steps += 1`)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Handle Even Number (`else`)**:\n",
    "    - If the current bit is '0' (even number):\n",
    "        - Check for existing carry (`if carry == 1`):\n",
    "            - If there's a carry from the previous bit, we need an extra step to resolve it (`steps += 1`)\n",
    "            - The carry is reset after being processed (`carry = 0`)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Final Carry (`return steps + carry`)**:\n",
    "    - After processing all bits, if there's a remaining `carry`, it signifies an extra step is needed to reduce the number to 1. We add it to the total `steps` before returning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input:** s = \"1101\" (binary representation of 13)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The input binary string `s = \"1101\"` is given.\n",
    "   * `steps` (counter for steps taken) is initialized to 0.\n",
    "   * `carry` (bit carried over from previous operations) is initialized to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bit-by-Bit Iterations (Right-to-Left, Skipping Last Bit):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Iteration 1 (Index 3, Bit '1'):**\n",
    "      * The bit is '1' (odd number).\n",
    "      * There's no existing carry, so adding 1 to the bit results in a new carry of 1.\n",
    "      * This step takes two operations (adding 1 and setting the carry), increasing `steps` to 2.\n",
    "   * **Iteration 2 (Index 2, Bit '0'):**\n",
    "      * The bit is '0' (even number).\n",
    "      * The existing carry of 1 is consumed, effectively adding 1 to the current position.\n",
    "      * This step also takes two operations (consuming the carry and dividing by 2), bringing `steps` to 4.\n",
    "   * **Iteration 3 (Index 1, Bit '1'):**\n",
    "      * The bit is '1' (odd number).\n",
    "      * The existing carry of remains because adding 1 to the bit results in another carry.\n",
    "      * Only one operation (adding 1) is needed this time, increasing `steps` to 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Final Carry Handling:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * After processing all bits except the least significant one, there's still a carry of 1.\n",
    "   * This remaining carry signifies an additional step to reduce the number to \"1.\"\n",
    "   * The final `steps` value is incremented by 1, resulting in a total of 6 steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Key Ideas:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* By working from right to left (least significant to most significant bits), the algorithm efficiently handles carries propagation. \n",
    "* Skipping the last bit is a clever optimization since adding 1 to the least significant bit never generates a carry that affects the overall number of steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- O(n), where n is the length of the binary number `s`. The code processes each bit once in reverse order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Space Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- O(1). The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space for 'steps' and 'carry.'"
