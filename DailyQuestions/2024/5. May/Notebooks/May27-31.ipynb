    "**Understanding the Core Idea**\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is essentially about finding the longest possible contiguous segment (substring) within a string `s` that can be transformed into the corresponding segment of another string `t`. The catch is that each character transformation has a cost, and you have a limited total budget (`max_cost`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The code solves this using a **sliding window** technique. Imagine a window that slides along the strings.  The window represents the current substring being considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The window starts small and expands to the right.\n",
    "2. The cost of transforming the characters within the window is tracked.\n",
    "3. If the cost exceeds the budget, the window's left side is moved to the right to shrink it until the cost fits the budget again.\n",
    "4. Throughout this process, the maximum length of a valid substring (one that fits the budget) is recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Walkthrough**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculate Costs:**\n",
    "   - `cost` is a list where each element represents the cost of transforming the character at index `i` in `s` to the corresponding character in `t`.\n",
    "   - The `ord` function gets the ASCII value of a character, and the absolute difference gives the transformation cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sliding Window:**\n",
    "   - `start_index` and `end_index` define the boundaries of the window.\n",
    "   - `total_cost` keeps track of the cumulative cost within the window.\n",
    "   - `max_length` stores the longest valid substring found so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Expanding the Window:**\n",
    "   - The `for` loop iterates through each character, effectively moving `end_index` to expand the window to the right.\n",
    "   - The cost of the new character is added to `total_cost`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Shrinking the Window (if necessary):**\n",
    "   - The `while` loop checks if `total_cost` exceeds the budget.\n",
    "   - If it does, the window shrinks from the left by:\n",
    "      - Removing the cost of the leftmost character (`cost[start_index]`).\n",
    "      - Incrementing `start_index`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Update Max Length:**\n",
    "   - After each iteration, the `max_length` is updated if the current window represents a longer valid substring than any previously seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Return Result:**\n",
    "   - Finally, the function returns `max_length`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input:**\n",
    "    - `s = \"abcd\"`\n",
    "    - `t = \"bcdf\"`\n",
    "    - `max_cost = 3`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Walkthrough:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Initialization:**\n",
    "    - The code first prints the input parameters for easy reference.\n",
    "    - The length of the strings `n` is calculated as 4.\n",
    "    - The `cost` array is computed, containing the absolute differences between the character codes of the corresponding characters in `s` and `t`: `[1, 1, 1, 2]`.\n",
    "    - `start_index` is set to 0, `total_cost` is initialized to 0, and `max_length` is set to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Sliding Window Iterations:**\n",
    "    - A loop iterates through each `end_index` from 0 to 3 (the length of the strings).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Iteration 1 (`end_index = 0`):**\n",
    "        -    The cost at `end_index = 0` (which is 1) is added to `total_cost`.\n",
    "        -    The current substrings are `\"a\"` and `\"b\"`.\n",
    "        -    Since `total_cost` (1) is less than or equal to `max_cost` (3), the window doesn't shrink, and `max_length` is updated to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Iteration 2 (`end_index = 1`):**\n",
    "        -    The cost at `end_index = 1` (which is 1) is added to `total_cost`, making it 2.\n",
    "        -    The current substrings become `\"ab\"` and `\"bc\"`.\n",
    "        -    Again, `total_cost` (2) is less than or equal to `max_cost` (3), so the window doesn't shrink, and `max_length` is updated to 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Iteration 3 (`end_index = 2`):**\n",
    "        -    The cost at `end_index = 2` (1) is added to `total_cost`, bringing it to 3.\n",
    "        -    The substrings are now `\"abc\"` and `\"bcd\"`.\n",
    "        -    `total_cost` (3) is still within the budget, so `max_length` becomes 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Iteration 4 (`end_index = 3`):**\n",
    "        -    The cost at `end_index = 3` (2) is added, increasing `total_cost` to 5.\n",
    "        -    The substrings are `\"abcd\"` and `\"bcdf\"`.\n",
    "        -    Now, `total_cost` (5) exceeds `max_cost` (3), triggering the `while` loop.\n",
    "        -    The loop shrinks the window from the left (increases `start_index`) until `total_cost` falls within the budget.\n",
    "        -    This results in a final substring pair of `\"cd\"` and `\"df\"` with a `total_cost` of 3.\n",
    "        -    Since the window shrank, `max_length` remains at its previous value of 3.\n",
