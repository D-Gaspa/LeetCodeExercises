    "The core idea of this solution is to find discrepancies between the current student heights and their ideal arrangement by sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ideal Order Representation:** A sorted copy of the original `heights` list is created. This sorted list, named `expected`, serves as the benchmark for the ideal order.\n",
    "- **Comparison and Counting:** By iterating through both the original `heights` and the sorted `expected` list, we compare elements at corresponding indices. Any mismatch indicates a student out of place, and we increment a counter to keep track.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Code Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Sorting for Reference:** \n",
    "    - `expected = sorted(heights)`: We create a sorted copy of the `heights` list, named `expected`. This provides us with a reference to how the heights should ideally be ordered (non-decreasing).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Initialization:**\n",
    "    - `unexpected_heights = 0`:  A counter is initialized to track the number of students who are not in their expected positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Comparison Loop:**\n",
    "    - `for index in range(len(heights))`: This loop iterates through each index of the `heights` list (and thus, also the `expected` list).\n",
    "    - `if heights[index] != expected[index]`:  At each index, it compares the height of the student in the original list (`heights[index]`) with the height of the student in the expected order (`expected[index]`).\n",
    "    - `unexpected_heights += 1`:  If the heights are not equal, it means the student is out of place, and the `unexpected_heights` counter is incremented.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Step-by-Step Walkthrough:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - The function starts by creating a sorted copy of the `heights` list, called `expected`. In this case, `expected` becomes `[1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.\n",

    "      - The algorithm compares `heights[1] = 1` with `expected[1] = 1`. They match, so `unexpected_heights` remains 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Iteration 3:**\n",
    "      - `index = 2`\n",
    "      - The algorithm compares `heights[2] = 4` with `expected[2] = 1`. Since they don't match (the student is taller than expected), `unexpected_heights` is incremented to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Iteration 4:**\n",
    "      - `index = 3`\n",
    "      - The algorithm compares `heights[3] = 2` with `expected[3] = 2`. They match, and `unexpected_heights` remains 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Iteration 5:**\n",
    "      - `index = 4`\n",
    "      - The algorithm compares `heights[4] = 1` with `expected[4] = 3`. Since they don't match, `unexpected_heights` is incremented to 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Iteration 6:**\n",
    "      - `index = 5`\n",
    "      - The algorithm compares `heights[5] = 3` with `expected[5] = 4`. Again, a mismatch is found, and `unexpected_heights` becomes 3.\n",

Instead of directly sorting elements through comparisons, it focuses on counting the frequency of each color and then reconstructing the array based on these counts.\n",

This strategy minimizes the overall movement required.\n",
    "- **Greedy Matching:** Once the arrays are sorted, we simply iterate through them in parallel and calculate the absolute difference (distance) between each student's position and their assigned seat's position. The sum of these absolute differences is the minimum number of moves needed.\n",

    "### Understanding the Core Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "The central concept of this solution is to leverage **sorting** to efficiently identify and increment duplicate values to make the array unique. By sorting the array, we bring duplicates together, allowing us to track the minimum required increments to make each element unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sorted Order Efficiency:** Sorting places elements in ascending order, guaranteeing that duplicates or elements needing increments are encountered sequentially.\n",
    "- **\"Prev\" Tracking:** The variable `prev` keeps track of the last unique value encountered. If the current value is less than or equal to `prev`, it signifies a duplicate or a value that's too small and needs incrementing.\n",
    "- **Incremental Adjustments:** When a duplicate/small value is found, it's incremented to be one greater than `prev`, and the number of increments is recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Code Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - `moves`: Initialized to 0 to keep track of the total increments required.\n",
    "   - `prev`: Initialized to -1, a value guaranteed to be smaller than any element in `nums`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sorting for Simplification:**\n",
    "   - `sorted(nums)`: Sorts the input array `nums` in ascending order, ensuring that duplicates (or values that are too small) are grouped together.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Iterative Incrementation:**\n",
    "   - `for num in sorted(nums)`: Iterates through each number in the sorted array.\n",
    "     - `if num <= prev`:  \n",
    "       - This condition identifies duplicates or values that need to be incremented.\n",
    "       - `moves += prev - num + 1`: Calculates the difference between the current value (`num`) and the previous unique value (`prev`). It adds 1 because we want to increment the value to be just larger than `prev`. The result is the number of increments needed, which is added to `moves`.\n",
    "       - `prev += 1`: Updates `prev` to the newly incremented (and now unique) value.\n",
    "     - `else`:\n",
    "       - This means the current number is already unique, so we simply update `prev` to this new value.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Result Calculation/Return:**\n",
    "   - `return moves`: Returns the total number of increments made, which is the minimum required to make all elements in the array unique.\n",

    "\n",
