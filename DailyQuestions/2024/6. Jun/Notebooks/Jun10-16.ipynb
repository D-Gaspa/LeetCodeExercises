    "The core idea of this solution is to find discrepancies between the current student heights and their ideal arrangement by sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ideal Order Representation:** A sorted copy of the original `heights` list is created. This sorted list, named `expected`, serves as the benchmark for the ideal order.\n",
    "- **Comparison and Counting:** By iterating through both the original `heights` and the sorted `expected` list, we compare elements at corresponding indices. Any mismatch indicates a student out of place, and we increment a counter to keep track.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Code Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Sorting for Reference:** \n",
    "    - `expected = sorted(heights)`: We create a sorted copy of the `heights` list, named `expected`. This provides us with a reference to how the heights should ideally be ordered (non-decreasing).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Initialization:**\n",
    "    - `unexpected_heights = 0`:  A counter is initialized to track the number of students who are not in their expected positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Comparison Loop:**\n",
    "    - `for index in range(len(heights))`: This loop iterates through each index of the `heights` list (and thus, also the `expected` list).\n",
    "    - `if heights[index] != expected[index]`:  At each index, it compares the height of the student in the original list (`heights[index]`) with the height of the student in the expected order (`expected[index]`).\n",
    "    - `unexpected_heights += 1`:  If the heights are not equal, it means the student is out of place, and the `unexpected_heights` counter is incremented.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Return Count:**\n",

    "**Step-by-Step Walkthrough:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - The function starts by creating a sorted copy of the `heights` list, called `expected`. In this case, `expected` becomes `[1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.\n",

    "      - `index = 0`\n",

    "      - `index = 1`\n",
    "      - The algorithm compares `heights[1] = 1` with `expected[1] = 1`. They match, so `unexpected_heights` remains 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Iteration 3:**\n",
    "      - `index = 2`\n",
    "      - The algorithm compares `heights[2] = 4` with `expected[2] = 1`. Since they don't match (the student is taller than expected), `unexpected_heights` is incremented to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Iteration 4:**\n",
    "      - `index = 3`\n",
    "      - The algorithm compares `heights[3] = 2` with `expected[3] = 2`. They match, and `unexpected_heights` remains 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Iteration 5:**\n",
    "      - `index = 4`\n",
    "      - The algorithm compares `heights[4] = 1` with `expected[4] = 3`. Since they don't match, `unexpected_heights` is incremented to 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Iteration 6:**\n",
    "      - `index = 5`\n",
    "      - The algorithm compares `heights[5] = 3` with `expected[5] = 4`. Again, a mismatch is found, and `unexpected_heights` becomes 3.\n",
