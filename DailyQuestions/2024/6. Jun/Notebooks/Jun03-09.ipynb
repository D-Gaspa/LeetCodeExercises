    "### Understanding the Core Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "The central concept of this solution is to leverage the definition of a subsequence to efficiently determine the minimum characters needed to append to `s` to form `t`. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Two Pointer Technique:** The solution uses two pointers (indices), `s_index` and `t_index`, to traverse strings `s` and `t` respectively.\n",
    "- **Greedy Matching:** The algorithm greedily matches characters from `t` within `s`. When a match is found, both pointers advance; otherwise, only the `s_index` (pointer for `s`) is incremented.\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Code Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - Initialize `s_index` and `t_index` to 0, starting from the beginning of both strings.\n",
    "   - Calculate and store the lengths of `s` and `t` (`s_length` and `t_length`) to avoid recomputing them in the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iteration and Matching (while loop):**\n",
    "   - The loop continues as long as we haven't reached the end of either string.\n",
    "   - Inside the loop:\n",
    "     - Compare the characters at `s_index` and `t_index`.\n",
    "     - If they match:\n",
    "       - This means we've found the next character in the subsequence of `t` within `s`.\n",
    "       - Increment both `s_index` and `t_index`.\n",
    "     - If they don't match:\n",
    "       - This means the current character in `s` is not part of the subsequence `t`.\n",
    "       - Only increment `s_index` to continue searching in `s`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Result Calculation/Return:**\n",
    "   - After the loop ends, `t_index` points to the position after the last matched character in `t`.\n",
    "   - The difference `t_length - t_index` represents the number of characters remaining in `t` that haven't been matched and need to be appended to `s`.\n",

    "**Input:** `s = \"coaching\"`, `t = \"coding\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-Step Walkthrough:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - `s_index` (pointer for `s`) is set to 0.\n",
    "   - `t_index` (pointer for `t`) is set to 0.\n",
    "   - `s_length` is calculated as 8 (length of \"coaching\").\n",
    "   - `t_length` is calculated as 6 (length of \"coding\").\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Main Loop (Comparing 's' and 't'):**\n",
    "    - **Iteration 1:**\n",
    "       - **Comparison:** `s[0]` ('c') matches `t[0]` ('c').\n",
    "       - **Action:**  Both `s_index` and `t_index` are incremented to 1.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Iteration 2:**\n",
    "       - **Comparison:** `s[1]` ('o') matches `t[1]` ('o').\n",
    "       - **Action:** Both `s_index` and `t_index` are incremented to 2.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Iterations 3 - 8:**\n",
    "       - **Comparison:** In each iteration, `s[s_index]` does not match `t[t_index]` ('d').\n",
    "       - **Action:** Only `s_index` is incremented.\n",
    "       - **Note:** We're essentially skipping over characters in `s` (\"aching\") that are not part of the subsequence we're looking for (\"coding\").\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Loop Termination:**\n",
    "   - The loop terminates because `s_index` reaches 8 (end of `s`).  \n",
    "   - At this point, `t_index` is still at 2.\n",

    "The core idea of this solution is to leverage the property that a palindrome must have pairs of characters, except for potentially one character in the center if the total length is odd. The solution uses a set (`character_set`) to efficiently track unique characters encountered in the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Set for Pairing:** A set is used to store characters encountered so far.  If a character is found in the set, it means we've seen its pair earlier, and we can increment the palindrome length by 2.\n",
    "- **Removing Pairs:** When a pair is found, the character is removed from the set. This ensures we don't count the same pair twice.\n",
    "- **Center Character:** After processing all characters, any remaining elements in the set represent unpaired characters. If there's at least one, it can be used as the center of the palindrome, adding 1 to the total length.\n",

    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - `character_set` is initialized as an empty set to store unique characters.\n",

    "       - If `char` is already in `character_set`, it means we've found its pair.\n",
    "       - We increment `result` by 2 (for the pair) and remove `char` from the set.\n",
    "     - **Add character to set:**\n",
    "       - If `char` is not in `character_set`, we add it to the set as a potential pair for a later character.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Center Character Check:**\n",
    "   - After processing all characters, we check if the `character_set` is not empty.\n",
    "     - If there are characters remaining, it means one of them can be used as the center of the palindrome.\n",
    "     - In this case, we increment the `result` by 1.\n",
