    "### Understanding the Core Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea of this solution is to find if the given integer `c` can be decomposed into the sum of two perfect squares using a two-pointer approach. Here's the breakdown of the concept:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Two-Pointer Approach:**\n",
    "    - The function initializes two pointers: `start_index` at 0 and `end_index` at the square root of `c`.  These pointers represent potential values of 'a' and 'b'.\n",
    "    - In each iteration, it calculates the `squares_sum` of the squares of these pointers.\n",
    "    - If `squares_sum` equals `c`, it means we've found a pair of integers (a, b) whose squares add up to `c`.\n",
    "    - If `squares_sum` is less than `c`, we increment `start_index` to increase the sum (since a^2 is the smaller term).\n",
    "    - If `squares_sum` is greater than `c`, we decrement `end_index` to decrease the sum (since b^2 is the larger term).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mathematical Basis:**\n",
    "    - The algorithm is based on the fact that if a number `c` can be expressed as the sum of two squares, the numbers `a` and `b` must each be less than or equal to the square root of `c`. This ensures we only check relevant values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Insights:**\n",
    "    - **Sorted Search Space:** The potential values of `a` and `b` that we check are inherently sorted due to the nature of squares. This allows us to efficiently narrow down the search space.\n",
    "    - **Early Termination:** If we find a match, we can return `True` immediately. If `start_index` crosses `end_index`, there's no need to continue searching.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Code Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "    - `start_index` is set to 0, representing the smallest possible square.\n",
    "    - `end_index` is set to the integer part of the square root of `c`, representing the largest possible square within the range.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Main Loop (Two-Pointer Search):**\n",
    "    - The `while` loop runs as long as `start_index` is less than or equal to `end_index`.\n",
    "    - In each iteration:\n",
    "        - `squares_sum` is calculated as `start_index * start_index + end_index * end_index`. \n",
    "        - **Decision Point (Conditional Statements):**\n",
    "            - If `squares_sum == c`, the function returns `True` (pair found).\n",
    "            - If `squares_sum < c`, we increase `start_index` by 1.\n",
    "            - If `squares_sum > c`, we decrease `end_index` by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Result Calculation/Return:**\n",
    "    - If the loop completes without finding a match, the function returns `False` (no pair exists). \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "\n",
    "- $O(\\sqrt{c})$ where `c` is the input integer. In the worst case, the `while` loop will run up to the square root of `c` times.\n",

    "\n",
    "- $O(1)$ (Constant): The algorithm uses only a fixed number of variables (`start_index`, `end_index`, `squares_sum`), and this number doesn't grow with the input size."

    "The core idea of this solution is to leverage Fermat's Theorem on sums of two squares to determine if a given number can be expressed as such. Fermat's theorem states:\n",
    "\n",
    "> An integer greater than one can be written as a sum of two squares if and only if its prime decomposition contains no prime congruent to 3 (mod 4) raised to an odd power.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler terms, a number can be expressed as the sum of two squares unless it has a prime factor of the form $4k + 3$ (such as 3, 7, 11, etc.) that appears an odd number of times in its prime factorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because a prime of the form (4k + 3) cannot be expressed as the sum of two squares (as opposed to primes of the form 4k + 1 which can always be expressed as the sum of two squares).\n",
    "When a prime of the form $4k + 3$ appears with an even exponent in the prime factorization of $c$, its contribution to the overall sum of squares can be paired off and effectively neutralized. However, if such a prime appears with an odd exponent, it cannot be paired off, and its presence fundamentally prevents $c$ from being expressed as the sum of two squares. This is because the square of any number is congruent to 0 or 1 (mod 4), but never 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important concept is the Brahmagupta-Fibonacci identity, which states that the product of two sums of two squares is itself a sum of two squares. This property allows us to combine the squares of two numbers to form a new sum of squares:\n",

    "(a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2) = (ac - bd)^2 + (ad + bc)^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This identity is crucial in the context of Fermat's theorem and the decomposition of numbers into sums of squares. When a prime factor $p$ of the form $4k + 3$ appears with an even exponent, it can be paired off to form a new sum of squares. $p^{2k} = (p^k)^2 + (0)^2$, and this can be combined with other sums of squares to form a larger sum of squares. However, if $p$ appears with an odd exponent, it cannot be paired off, and the number cannot be expressed as a sum of squares due to the presence of the lone $p$ term (which is congruent to 3 mod 4 and cannot be expressed as a sum of squares).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prime Factorization:** The solution systematically checks for prime factors of $c$ up to its square root.\n",

    "- **Checking Fermat's Condition:** If a prime factor of the form $4k + 3$ has an odd `divisors_count`, the number cannot be a sum of squares (returns `False`).\n",
    "- **Base Case:** After iterating through smaller primes, the remaining value of $c$ is either 1 or a prime. It checks if this remaining prime is of the form $4k + 3$. If it is, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.\n",
