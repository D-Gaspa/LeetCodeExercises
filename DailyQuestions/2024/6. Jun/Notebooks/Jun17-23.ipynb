    "### Understanding the Core Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea of this solution is to find if the given integer `c` can be decomposed into the sum of two perfect squares using a two-pointer approach. Here's the breakdown of the concept:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Two-Pointer Approach:**\n",
    "    - The function initializes two pointers: `start_index` at 0 and `end_index` at the square root of `c`.  These pointers represent potential values of 'a' and 'b'.\n",
    "    - In each iteration, it calculates the `squares_sum` of the squares of these pointers.\n",
    "    - If `squares_sum` equals `c`, it means we've found a pair of integers (a, b) whose squares add up to `c`.\n",
    "    - If `squares_sum` is less than `c`, we increment `start_index` to increase the sum (since a^2 is the smaller term).\n",
    "    - If `squares_sum` is greater than `c`, we decrement `end_index` to decrease the sum (since b^2 is the larger term).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mathematical Basis:**\n",
    "    - The algorithm is based on the fact that if a number `c` can be expressed as the sum of two squares, the numbers `a` and `b` must each be less than or equal to the square root of `c`. This ensures we only check relevant values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Insights:**\n",
    "    - **Sorted Search Space:** The potential values of `a` and `b` that we check are inherently sorted due to the nature of squares. This allows us to efficiently narrow down the search space.\n",
    "    - **Early Termination:** If we find a match, we can return `True` immediately. If `start_index` crosses `end_index`, there's no need to continue searching.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Code Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "    - `start_index` is set to 0, representing the smallest possible square.\n",
    "    - `end_index` is set to the integer part of the square root of `c`, representing the largest possible square within the range.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Main Loop (Two-Pointer Search):**\n",
    "    - The `while` loop runs as long as `start_index` is less than or equal to `end_index`.\n",
    "    - In each iteration:\n",
    "        - `squares_sum` is calculated as `start_index * start_index + end_index * end_index`. \n",
    "        - **Decision Point (Conditional Statements):**\n",
    "            - If `squares_sum == c`, the function returns `True` (pair found).\n",
    "            - If `squares_sum < c`, we increase `start_index` by 1.\n",
    "            - If `squares_sum > c`, we decrease `end_index` by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Result Calculation/Return:**\n",
    "    - If the loop completes without finding a match, the function returns `False` (no pair exists). \n",

    "\n",
    "In simpler terms, a number can be expressed as the sum of two squares unless it has a prime factor of the form $4k + 3$ (such as 3, 7, 11, etc.) that appears an odd number of times in its prime factorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because a prime of the form $4k + 3$ cannot be expressed as the sum of two squares (as opposed to primes of the form $4k + 1$ which can always be expressed as the sum of two squares).\n",
    "When a prime of the form $4k + 3$ appears with an even exponent in the prime factorization of $c$, its contribution to the overall sum of squares can be paired off and effectively neutralized. However, if such a prime appears with an odd exponent, it cannot be paired off, and its presence fundamentally prevents $c$ from being expressed as the sum of two squares. This is because the square of any number is congruent to 0 or 1 (mod 4), but never 3.\n",

However, if $p$ appears with an odd exponent, it cannot be paired off, and the number cannot be expressed as a sum of squares due to the presence of the lone $p$ term (which is congruent to 3 mod 4).\n",

    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sorting:** Sorting both `jobs` and `worker` is crucial for efficiency.\n",
    "- **Two Pointers:** The `index` variable acts as a pointer into the `jobs` array, avoiding redundant job checks.\n",

    "    - $n$ is the number of jobs\n",

    "    - Sorts the workers: $O(m \\log m)$\n",
    "    - Iterates over jobs and workers: While the nested loops might seem like $O(n \\cdot m)$, note that the `index` for jobs only increases and never goes back. So, in total, we iterate over each job and each worker only once, resulting in $O(n + m)$.  \n",

    "**Space Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- $O(n)$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because the algorithm uses additional space for the `jobs` list which has the same length as the input lists `difficulty` and `profit` (2n elements).\n",
    "The space complexity is dominated by the storage of the sorted job list, hence $O(n)$."
