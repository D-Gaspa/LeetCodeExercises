# 633. Sum of Square Numbers

# Given a non-negative integer `c`, decide whether there are two integers `a` and `b` such that `a^2 + b^2 = c`.


def judgeSquareSum1(c: int) -> bool:
    """
    Determines if a given non-negative integer 'c' can be expressed as the sum of squares of two integers 'a' and 'b'.

    The function uses a two-pointer technique starting from 0 and square root of 'c'.
    It then iteratively checks the sum of squares of the two pointers, 'start_index' and 'end_index'.
    If the sum is less than 'c', it increases the start_index to get a larger sum.
    If it's greater than 'c', it reduces the end_index to get a smaller sum.
    If it's equal to 'c', the function immediately returns True because it has found the pair of numbers.
    If no pair satisfying the condition is found after the loop, it returns False.
    This approach works because for every value of 'c', if there exist two numbers 'a' and 'b' such that a^2 + b^2 = c,
    then 'a' and 'b' must each be less than or equal to sqrt(c).

    The time complexity of this function is O(âˆšc) because in the worst case,
    the while loop iterates up to the square root of c times.
    The space complexity is O(1) as it uses a constant amount of extra space.
