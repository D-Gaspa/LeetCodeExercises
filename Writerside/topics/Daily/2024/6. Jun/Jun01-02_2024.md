## June 1 -> 3110. Score of a String {collapsible="true" default-state="collapsed"}

You are given a string `s`.
The **score** of a string is defined as the sum of the absolute difference between the
**ASCII** values of adjacent characters.

Return the **score** of `s`.

**Example 1:**

- **Input:** s = "hello"
- **Output:** 13
- **Explanation:**
    - The **ASCII** values of the characters in `s` are: `'h' = 104`, `'e' = 101`, `'l' = 108`, `'o' = 111`.
      So, the score of `s` would be `|104 - 101| + |101 - 108| + |108 - 108| + |108 - 111| = 3 + 7 + 0 + 3 = 13`.

**Example 2:**

- **Input:** s = "zaz"
- **Output:** 50
- **Explanation:**
    - The **ASCII** values of the characters in `s` are: `'z' = 122`, `'a' = 97`.
      So, the score of `s` would be `|122 - 97| + |97 - 122| = 25 + 25 = 50`.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= s.length <= 100`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

### Approach 1: Linear Iteration with ASCII Value Comparison {id="approach_d1_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

```Python
def scoreOfString(s: str) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the total score of a string based on absolute differences
    between adjacent character ASCII values.

    This function iterates through each pair of adjacent characters in the
    string, calculates the absolute difference between their ASCII values,
    and accumulates this into a total score.

    The time complexity of this function is O(n), where `n` is the length of
    the string. This is because it performs a single iteration over the
    string's characters. The space complexity is O(1) as it uses a constant
    amount of extra space to store variables.
    """
    n = len(s)
    total_score = 0

    for index in range(n - 1):
        total_score += abs((ord(s[index]) - ord(s[index + 1])))

    # Alternatively, you can use pairwise from itertools to get the pairs of
    # adjacent characters s -> (s0, s1), (s1, s2), (s2, s3), ...
    # This alternative approach would have similar time and space
    # complexities, but offers a more concise way of generating pairs

    return total_score
```

#### Understanding the Core Idea {id="core-idea_d1_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

The central concept of this solution is to leverage ASCII value comparisons and linear iteration to calculate the score
of the string.
The solution exploits the fact that characters can be converted to their ASCII values, allowing for
numerical comparisons.

- **ASCII Value Conversion:** The solution uses the `ord()` function to convert characters to their ASCII values,
  enabling numerical operations.
- **Adjacent Character Comparison:** By iterating through the string, the solution compares each character with its
  adjacent neighbor, calculating the absolute difference between their ASCII values.
- **Cumulative Scoring:** The solution accumulates these differences into a total score, representing the overall "
  distance" between adjacent characters in the ASCII table.

> **Key Insight:**
> The problem can be solved in a single pass through the string, without the need for complex data
> structures or algorithms, by leveraging the linear nature of both the string and the scoring process.

#### Code Walkthrough {id="code-walkthrough_d1_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

1. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   n = len(s)
   total_score = 0
   ```
   Here, we initialize two key variables:
    - `n`: Stores the length of the input string for efficient access later.
    - `total_score`: Initializes the accumulator for the string's score.

2. **Main Iteration and Score Calculation:**
   ```python
   for index in range(n - 1):
       total_score += abs((ord(s[index]) - ord(s[index + 1])))
   ```
   This is the core of the algorithm:
    - The loop iterates `n-1` times, as we're comparing pairs of adjacent characters.
    - For each pair, we:
        1. Convert both characters to their ASCII values using `ord()`.
        2. Calculate the difference between these ASCII values.
        3. Take the absolute value of this difference using `abs()`.
        4. Add this value to the `total_score`.

3. **Result Return:**
   ```python
   return total_score
   ```
   After the iteration is complete, the function returns the accumulated `total_score`, which represents the final score
   of the string according to the problem's definition.

#### Complexity Analysis {id="complexity-analysis_d1_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Time Complexity:**

- $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input string `s`.
  This is because the algorithm performs a single pass through the string,
  processing each character exactly once (except the last character, which is only used in the final comparison).

**Space Complexity:**

- $O(1)$, or constant space.
  The algorithm uses a fixed amount of additional space regardless of the input size.
  It only requires a few variables (`n`, `total_score`, and `index`) to perform its calculations,
  and these do not scale with the input size.

---

#### Example {id="example_d1_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Input:**

```Python
s = "hello"
```

**Step-by-Step Walkthrough:**

1. **Initialization:**
    - The function receives the input string `s = 'hello'`.
    - The length of the string, `n`, is calculated as 5.
    - The `total_score` variable is initialized to 0.

2. **Main Loop (Calculating Character Pair Scores):**

    - **Iteration 1:**
        - `index = 0` (first character 'h')
        - `char1 = 'h'`, `char2 = 'e'` (adjacent pair)
        - `char1_ascii = 104`, `char2_ascii = 101` (ASCII values)
        - `pair_score = abs(104 - 101) = 3`
        - `total_score = 3` (updated)

    - **Iteration 2:**
        - `index = 1` (second character 'e')
        - `char1 = 'e'`, `char2 = 'l'` (adjacent pair)
        - `char1_ascii = 101`, `char2_ascii = 108` (ASCII values)
        - `pair_score = abs(101 - 108) = 7`
        - `total_score = 10` (updated)

    - **Iteration 3:**
        - `index = 2` (third character 'l')
        - `char1 = 'l'`, `char2 = 'l'` (adjacent pair)
        - `char1_ascii = 108`, `char2_ascii = 108` (ASCII values)
        - `pair_score = abs(108 - 108) = 0`
        - `total_score = 10` (no change)

    - **Iteration 4:**
        - `index = 3` (fourth character 'l')
        - `char1 = 'l'`, `char2 = 'o'` (adjacent pair)
        - `char1_ascii = 108`, `char2_ascii = 111` (ASCII values)
        - `pair_score = abs(108 - 111) = 3`
        - `total_score = 13` (updated)

3. **Iteration Summary (Character Pair Scores):**
    - The table below summarizes the calculations performed during each iteration of the loop.

   | Iteration | Char 1 | Char 2 | ASCII 1 | ASCII 2 | Pair Score | Total Score |
   |-----------|--------|--------|---------|---------|------------|-------------|
   | 1         | h      | e      | 104     | 101     | 3          | 3           |
   | 2         | e      | l      | 101     | 108     | 7          | 10          |
   | 3         | l      | l      | 108     | 108     | 0          | 10          |
   | 4         | l      | o      | 108     | 111     | 3          | 13          |

4. **Function Returning:**
    - The function returns the final calculated `total_score`, which is 13.

## June 2 -> 344. Reverse String {collapsible="true" default-state="collapsed"}

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with `O(1)` extra memory.

**Example 1:**

- **Input:** s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
- **Output:** ["o","l","l","e","h"]

**Example 2:**

- **Input:** s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
- **Output:** ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s[i]` is a printable ascii character.

### Approach 1: Two Pointer Technique {id="approach_d2_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

```Python
def reverseString1(s: List[str]) -> None:
    """
    This function reverses the order of elements in a character array 
    in-place.

    This function uses a two-pointer approach, where one pointer starts from
    the beginning (`left_index`), and the other one starts from the end of
    the array (`right_index`). The characters at these two pointers are
    swapped, and the pointers are moved towards each other. This carries on
    until the two pointers meet or pass each other, which suggests that the
    array is now reversed.

    The time complexity of this function is O(n), where `n` is the number of
    elements in the list. The space complexity is O(1) because it operates
    directly on the input list and uses a constant amount of additional
    memory for the index variables.
    """
    left_index = 0
    right_index = len(s) - 1

    while left_index < right_index:
        # Swap the characters at the current left and right indices
        s[left_index], s[right_index] = s[right_index], s[left_index]

        left_index += 1
        right_index -= 1
```

#### Understanding the Core Idea {id="core-idea_d2_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

The central concept of this solution is to leverage the two-pointer technique to reverse the string in-place.
This approach efficiently swaps characters from both ends of the string, moving towards the center.

- **In-Place Reversal:** The solution modifies the input array directly, adhering to the $O(1)$ extra memory constraint.
- **Two-Pointer Mechanism:** By using two pointers that start at opposite ends and move towards each other, we ensure
  that each character is swapped exactly once.
- **Midpoint Convergence:** The process naturally stops when the pointers meet or cross, indicating that all necessary
  swaps have been completed.

> **Key Insight:**
> The solution elegantly handles both odd and even-length strings without requiring separate logic, as
> the pointers will either meet (odd length) or cross (even length) at the appropriate point.

#### Code Walkthrough {id="code-walkthrough_d2_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

1. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   left_index = 0
   right_index = len(s) - 1
   ```
   We set up two pointers: `left_index` at the start of the string and `right_index` at the end.
   These will be used to traverse the string from both ends simultaneously.

2. **Iteration and Swapping:**
   ```python
   while left_index < right_index:
       s[left_index], s[right_index] = s[right_index], s[left_index]
       left_index += 1
       right_index -= 1
   ```
   This loop continues as long as `left_index` is less than `right_index`, ensuring we stop in the middle of the string.
   In each iteration:
    - We swap the characters at `left_index` and `right_index` using Python's multiple assignment feature.
    - We then move `left_index` one step to the right and `right_index` one step to the left.

   This process effectively reverses the string by swapping characters from the outside in.

3. **Implicit Return:**
   The function doesn't explicitly return anything (`-> None`), as it modifies the input list in-place.
   The reversed string is available in the original `s` list after the function execution.

#### Complexity Analysis {id="complexity-analysis_d2_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Time Complexity:**

- $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input string.
  This is because we iterate through half of the string, performing constant-time operations (swapping) for each pair of
  characters.
  Even though we only traverse half the string in Big $O$ notation, this is still considered $O(n)$.

**Space Complexity:**

- $O(1)$, as we use only a constant amount of extra space (the two index variables) regardless of the input size.
  The reversal is performed in-place, modifying the original input array without requiring any additional data
  structures that scale with input size.

---

#### Example {id="example_d2_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Input:** 
```Python
s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
```

**Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

1. **Initialization:**
    - `left_index` is set to 0, pointing to the first element ('h').
    - `right_index` is set to 4 (len(s) - 1), pointing to the last element ('o').

2. **Main Loop (Reversing In-Place):**
    - **Iteration 1:**
        - **Before swap:** `s = ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']`, `left_index = 0`, `right_index = 4`
        - **Swap:** The characters at index 0 ('h') and index 4 ('o') are swapped.
        - **After swap:** `s = ['o', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'h']`, `left_index = 0`, `right_index = 4`
        - **Update pointers:**  `left_index` is incremented to 1, and `right_index` is decremented to 3.

    - **Iteration 2:**
        - **Before swap:** `s = ['o', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'h']`, `left_index = 1`, `right_index = 3`
        - **Swap:** The characters at index 1 ('e') and index 3 ('l') are swapped.
        - **After swap:** `s = ['o', 'l', 'l', 'e', 'h']`, `left_index = 1`, `right_index = 3`
        - **Update pointers:** `left_index` is incremented to 2, and `right_index` is decremented to 2.

3. **Iteration Summary (Swaps and List States)**
    
    | Iteration | Left Index | Right Index | List (s)                  |
    |-----------|------------|-------------|---------------------------|
    | 1         | 0          | 4           | ['o', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'h'] |
    | 2         | 1          | 3           | ['o', 'l', 'l', 'e', 'h'] |

4. **Loop Termination:**
    - When `left_index` and `right_index` cross (at index 2), the array reversal is complete.
    - The final reversed array is `s = ['o', 'l', 'l', 'e', 'h']`.
    - The function has successfully reversed the input array in-place.
      It does not return a new array but modifies the input array directly.
