## June 17 -> 633. Sum of Square Numbers {collapsible="true" default-state="collapsed"}

Given a non-negative integer `c`, decide whether there are two integers `a` and `b` such that `a^2 + b^2 = c`.

**Example 1:**

- **Input:** c = 5
- **Output:** true
- **Explanation:** 1 * 1 + 2 * 2 = 5

**Example 2:**

- **Input:** c = 3
- **Output:** false

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= c <= 2^31 - 1`

```Python
def judgeSquareSum1(c: int) -> bool:
    """
    Determines if a given non-negative integer 'c' can be expressed as
    the sum of squares of two integers 'a' and 'b'.

    The function uses a two-pointer technique starting from 0 and the
    square root of 'c'. It iteratively checks the sum of squares of
    the two pointers, 'start_index' and 'end_index'. If the sum is
    less than 'c', it increases 'start_index' to get a larger sum.
    If the sum is greater than 'c', it decreases 'end_index' to get
    a smaller sum. If the sum is equal to 'c', the function returns
    True as it has found the pair of numbers. If no such pair is found
    after the loop, it returns False. This approach works because if
    there exist two numbers 'a' and 'b' such that a^2 + b^2 = c, then
    'a' and 'b' must each be less than or equal to sqrt(c).

    The time complexity of this function is O(√c) because, in the
    worst case, the while loop iterates up to the square root of 'c' times.
    The space complexity is O(1) as it uses a constant amount of extra space.

#### Understanding the Core Idea {id="core-idea_d1_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

The core idea of this solution is to find if the given integer `c` can be decomposed into the sum of two perfect squares
using a two-pointer approach.
Here's the breakdown of the concept:

- **Two-Pointer Approach:**
    - The function initializes two pointers: `start_index` at 0 and `end_index` at the square root of `c`.
      These pointers represent potential values of 'a' and 'b'.
    - In each iteration, it calculates the `squares_sum` of the squares of these pointers.
    - If `squares_sum` equals `c`, it means we've found a pair of integers (a, b) whose squares add up to `c`.
    - If `squares_sum` is less than `c`, we increment `start_index` to increase the sum (since a^2 is the smaller term).
    - If `squares_sum` is greater than `c`, we decrement `end_index` to decrease the sum (since b^2 is the larger term).

- **Mathematical Basis:**
    - The algorithm is based on the fact that if a number `c` can be expressed as the sum of two squares, the
      numbers `a` and `b` must each be less than or equal to the square root of `c`.
      This ensures we only check relevant values.

> **Key Insights:**
>
> **Sorted Search Space:** The potential values of `a` and `b` that we check are inherently sorted due to the nature of
> squares.
> This allows us to efficiently narrow down the search space.
>
> **Early Termination:** If we find a match, we can return `True` immediately.
> If `start_index` crosses `end_index`, there's no need to continue searching.

#### Code Walkthrough {id="code-walkthrough_d1_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

1. **Initialization:**
    - `start_index` is set to 0, representing the smallest possible square.
    - `end_index` is set to the integer part of the square root of `c`, representing the largest possible square within
      the range.

2. **Main Loop (Two-Pointer Search):**
    - The `while` loop runs as long as `start_index` is less than or equal to `end_index`.
    - In each iteration:
        - `squares_sum` is calculated as `start_index * start_index + end_index * end_index`.
        - **Decision Point (Conditional Statements):**
            - If `squares_sum == c`, the function returns `True` (pair found).
            - If `squares_sum < c`, we increase `start_index` by 1.
            - If `squares_sum > c`, we decrease `end_index` by 1.

3. **Result Calculation/Return:**
    - If the loop completes without finding a match, the function returns `False` (no pair exists).

#### Example {id="example_d1_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Input:** `c = 98`

**Step-by-Step Walkthrough:**

1. **Initialization:**
    - `start_index` is set to 0.
    - `end_index` is set to the integer part of the square root of 98, which is 9.

2. **Main Loop (Two-Pointer Search):**

    - **While $0 \leq 9$ (Iteration 1):**
        - `squares_sum` = $0^2 + 9^2 = 81$
        - Since 81 < 98, we increment `start_index` to 1.

    - **While $1 \leq 9$ (Iteration 2):**
        - `squares_sum` = $1^2 + 9^2 = 82$
        - Since 82 < 98, we increment `start_index` to 2.

    - **While $2 \leq 9$ (Iteration 3):**
        - `squares_sum` = $2^2 + 9^2 = 85$
        - Since 85 < 98, we increment `start_index` to 3.

    - **While $3 \leq 9$ (Iteration 4):**
        - `squares_sum` = $3^2 + 9^2 = 90$
        - Since 90 < 98, we increment `start_index` to 4.

    - **While $4 \leq 9$ (Iteration 5):**
        - `squares_sum` = $4^2 + 9^2 = 97$
        - Since 97 < 98, we increment `start_index` to 5.

    - **While $5 \leq 9$ (Iteration 6):**
        - `squares_sum` = $5^2 + 9^2 = 106$
        - Since 106 > 98, we decrement `end_index` to 8.

    - **While $5 \leq 8$ (Iteration 7):**
        - `squares_sum` = $5^2 + 8^2 = 89$
        - Since 89 < 98, we increment `start_index` to 6.

    - **While $6 \leq 8$ (Iteration 8):**
        - `squares_sum` = $6^2 + 8^2 = 100$
        - Since 100 > 98, we decrement `end_index` to 7.

    - **While $6 \leq 7$ (Iteration 9):**
        - `squares_sum` = $6^2 + 7^2 = 85$
        - Since 85 < 98, we increment `start_index` to 7.

    - **While $7 \leq 7$ (Iteration 10):**
        - `squares_sum` = $7^2 + 7^2 = 98$
        - Since 98 == 98, we have found a valid pair (7, 7), and the function returns `True`.

3. **Loop Termination:** The loop terminates when `squares_sum == c`, indicating a valid pair of integers has been
   found.

4. **Iteration Summary:**

   | `start_index` | `end_index` | `squares_sum` | Comparison | Action             |
            |---------------|-------------|---------------|------------|--------------------|
   | 0             | 9           | 81            | 81 < 98    | `start_index += 1` |
   | 1             | 9           | 82            | 82 < 98    | `start_index += 1` |
   | 2             | 9           | 85            | 85 < 98    | `start_index += 1` |
   | 3             | 9           | 90            | 90 < 98    | `start_index += 1` |
   | 4             | 9           | 97            | 97 < 98    | `start_index += 1` |
   | 5             | 9           | 106           | 106 > 98   | `end_index -= 1`   |
   | 5             | 8           | 89            | 89 < 98    | `start_index += 1` |
   | 6             | 8           | 100           | 100 > 98   | `end_index -= 1`   |
   | 6             | 7           | 85            | 85 < 98    | `start_index += 1` |
   | 7             | 7           | 98            | 98 == 98   | Return True        |

5. **Result Calculation/Final Steps:**
    - The function directly returns `True` as soon as it finds the valid pair (7, 7).
      It does not need to calculate or return any additional values.
    - The pair (7, 7) satisfies the condition $7^2 + 7^2 = 98$, confirming that 98 can be expressed as the sum of two
      squares.

#### Complexity Analysis {id="complexity-analysis_d1_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Time Complexity:**

- $O(\sqrt{c})$ where $c$ is the input integer.
  In the worst case, the `while` loop will run up to the square root of $c$ times.

**Space Complexity:**

- $O(1)$ (Constant): The algorithm uses only a fixed number of variables (`start_index`, `end_index`, `squares_sum`),
  and this number doesn't grow with the input size.

#### Understanding the Core Idea {id="core-idea_d1_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

The core idea of this solution is to leverage Fermat's Theorem on sums of two squares to determine if a given number
can be expressed as such.
Fermat's theorem states:

> An integer greater than one can be written as a sum of two squares if and only if its prime decomposition contains
> no prime congruent to 3 (mod 4) raised to an odd power.
>
{style="info"}

In simpler terms, a number can be expressed as the sum of two squares unless it has a prime factor of the form $4k + 3$
(such as 3, 7, 11, etc.) that appears an odd number of times in its prime factorization.

This is because a prime of the form $4k + 3$ cannot be expressed as the sum of two squares
(as opposed to primes of the form $4k + 1$ which can always be expressed as the sum of two squares).
When a prime of the form $4k + 3$ appears with an even exponent in the prime factorization of $c$,
its contribution to the overall sum of squares can be paired off and effectively neutralized.
However, if such a prime appears with an odd exponent, it cannot be paired off,
and its presence fundamentally prevents $c$ from being expressed as the sum of two squares.
This is because the square of any number is congruent to 0 or 1 (mod 4), but never 3.

Another important concept is the Brahmagupta-Fibonacci identity, which states that the product of two sums of two
squares is itself a sum of two squares.
This property allows us to combine the squares of two numbers to form a new sum of squares:

$$
(a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2) = (ac - bd)^2 + (ad + bc)^2
$$

This identity is crucial in the context of Fermat's theorem and the decomposition of numbers into sums of squares.
When a prime factor $p$ of the form $4k + 3$ appears with an even exponent,
it can be paired off to form a new sum of squares: $p^{2k} = (p^k)^2 + (0)^2$, and this can be combined with other
sums of squares to form a larger sum of squares.
However, if $p$ appears with an odd exponent, it cannot be paired off.
The number cannot be expressed as a sum of squares due to the presence of the lone $p$ term
(which is congruent to 3 mod 4).

- **Prime Factorization:** The solution systematically checks for prime factors of $c$ up to its square root.
- **Counting Divisibility:** For each prime factor, it counts how many times it divides $c$ evenly (tracked
  by `divisors_count`).
- **Checking Fermat's Condition:** If a prime factor of the form $4k + 3$ has an odd `divisors_count`, the number cannot
  be a sum of squares (returns `False`).
- **Base Case:** After iterating through smaller primes, the remaining value of $c$ is either 1 or a prime.
  It checks if this remaining prime is of the form $4k + 3$.
  If it is, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.

#### Code Walkthrough {id="code-walkthrough_d1_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

1. **Initialization:**
    - `index` is initialized to 2, the smallest prime number.

2. **Main Loop (Checking Prime Factors):**
    - The `while` loop iterates as long as the square of `index` (potential prime factor) is less than or equal to `c`.
    - **Inner Loop (Counting Divisors):**
        - If `c` is divisible by `index`, a nested `while` loop repeatedly divides `c` by `index` to count its
          occurrences.
    - **Decision Points (Fermat's Condition):**
        - After the inner loop, it checks if `divisors_count` is odd (indicating an odd power) and if `index` is of the
          form `4k + 3`.
          If both are true, the function returns `False`.

3. **Base Case (After Main Loop):**
    - If the main loop completes without returning, `c` is either 1 or a prime.
    - It checks if the remaining `c` is of the form `4k + 3`. If so, it returns `False`; otherwise, `True`.

#### Example {id="example_d1_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Input:** `c = 98`

**Step-by-Step Walkthrough:**

1. **Initialization:**
    - `index` is initialized to 2, the smallest prime number.

2. **Main Loop (Checking Prime Factors):**

    - **While $2 \times 2 = 4 \leq 98$ (Iteration 1):**
        - `index = 2`
        - `c` is divisible by `index` (98 % 2 == 0).
        - Inner loop counts the divisors: `divisors_count = 1`, `c = 49` (after division)
        - `divisors_count` is 1 and `index` (2) is not of the form 4k+3, so the loop continues.
        - `index` is incremented to 3.

    - **While $3 \times 3 = 9 \leq 49$ (Iteration 2):**
        - `index = 3`
        - `c` is not divisible by `index` (49 % 3 != 0), so the loop continues.
        - `index` is incremented to 4.

    - **While $4 \times 4 = 16 \leq 49$ (Iteration 3):**
        - `index = 4`
        - `c` is not divisible by `index` (49 % 4 != 0), so the loop continues.
        - `index` is incremented to 5.

    - **While $5 \times 5 = 25 \leq 49$ (Iteration 4):**
        - `index = 5`
        - `c` is not divisible by `index` (49 % 5 != 0), so the loop continues.
        - `index` is incremented to 6.

    - **While $6 \times 6 = 36 \leq 49$ (Iteration 5):**
        - `index = 6`
        - `c` is not divisible by `index` (49 % 6 != 0), so the loop continues.
        - `index` is incremented to 7.

    - **While $7 \times 7 = 49 \leq 49$ (Iteration 6):**
        - `index = 7`
        - `c` is divisible by `index` (49 % 7 == 0).
        - Inner loop counts the divisors:
            - `divisors_count = 1`, `c = 7`
            - `divisors_count = 2`, `c = 1`
        - `index` (7) is of the form 4k+3, but since `divisors_count` is even (2), the loop continues.
        - `index` is incremented to 8.

3. **Loop Termination:** The loop terminates after iteration 6 because `index * index` (64) is not less than or equal to
   the current value of `c` (1).

4. **Iteration Summary/Visual Aids:**

   | `c` | `index` | `divisors_count` | `index % 4 == 3` | Result                   |
            |-----|---------|------------------|------------------|--------------------------|
   | 108 | 2       | 1                | False            | Continue                 |
   | 49  | 3       | 0                | False            | Continue                 |
   | 49  | 4       | 0                | False            | Continue                 |
   | 49  | 5       | 0                | False            | Continue                 |
   | 49  | 6       | 0                | False            | Continue                 |
   | 49  | 7       | 2                | True             | Continue (Even exponent) |

5. **Result Calculation/Final Steps:**
    - After the loop, `c` is 1. Since 1 is not of the form 4k + 3, the function returns `True`, indicating that 98 can
      be expressed as the sum of two squares $(7^2 + 7^2 = 98)$.

6. **Visualizing the Pairing of Squares:**
    - Since the factorization of 98 is $2 \cdot 7^2$, the prime factor 7 (of the form $4k + 3$) appears with an even
      exponent (2), allowing it to be paired off and expressed as a sum of squares.
    - This can be visualized using the Brahmagupta-Fibonacci identity to combine the squares of 7 into a new sum of
      squares:
        - We know that $2 = 1^2 + 1^2$, and we can express $7^2$ as $7^2 + 0^2$.
          With the factorization, we get the product of these two sums of squares:
            - $(1^2 + 1^2) \cdot (7^2 + 0^2) = 98$.
        - Using the identity, we can combine these to get $(1 \cdot 7 - 1 \cdot 0)^2 + (1 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 7)^2 = 7^2 +
          7^2 = 98$.

#### Complexity Analysis {id="complexity-analysis_d1_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Time Complexity:**

- $O(\sqrt{c} \log c)$.
  The main loop runs up to $\sqrt{c}$ times.
  For each iteration, the inner loop might run up to $\log c$ times in the worst case
  (for a prime that divides `c` many times).

**Space Complexity:**

- $O(1)$ (Constant): The algorithm uses a fixed number of variables (`index`, `divisors_count`, `c`), regardless of the
  input size.

## June 18 -> 826. Most Profit Assigning Work {collapsible="true" default-state="collapsed"}

You have `n` jobs and `m` workers. You are given three arrays: `difficulty`, `profit`, and `worker` where:

- `difficulty[i]` and `profit[i]` are the difficulty and the profit of the `ith` job, and
- `worker[j]` is the ability of `jth` worker (i.e., the `jth` worker can only complete a job with difficulty at
  most `worker[j]`).

Every worker can be assigned **at most one job**, but one job can be **completed multiple times**.

- For example, if three workers attempt the same job that pays 1 dollar, then the total profit will be 3 dollars.
  If a worker cannot complete any job, their profit is `$0`.

Return the maximum profit we can achieve after assigning the workers to the jobs.

**Example 1:**

- **Input:** difficulty = [2,4,6,8,10], profit = [10,20,30,40,50], worker = [4,5,6,7]
- **Output:** 100
- **Explanation:**
    - Workers are assigned jobs of difficulty [4,4,6,6], and they get a profit of [20,20,30,30] separately.

**Example 2:**

- **Input:** difficulty = [85,47,57], profit = [24,66,99], worker = [40,25,25]
- **Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

- `n == difficulty.length`
- `n == profit.length`
- `m == worker.length`
- `1 <= n, m <= 10^4`
- `1 <= difficulty[i], profit[i], worker[i] <= 10^5`

### Approach 1: Memoization Name {id="approach_d2_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

```Python
def maxProfitAssignment1(difficulty: List[int], profit: List[int],
                         worker: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the maximum total profit that workers can achieve based
    on their abilities and the given jobs' difficulties and profits.

    The function first determines the maximum ability of all workers,
    then initializes a list to store the maximum profit for each level
    of difficulty up to this maximum ability. By iterating through
    each job's difficulty and profit, it updates this list to ensure
    it captures the highest profit available for each difficulty level
    up to the maximum ability. The function then adjusts this list so
    that for any given difficulty, it reflects the highest-profit
    achievable up to that difficulty level, because a job with a lower
    difficulty may have a higher profit. Finally, it sums up the highest
    possible profit for each worker based on their respective abilities.

#### Understanding the Core Idea {id="core-idea_d2_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

The core idea of this solution is to leverage a precomputed list of maximum profits achievable for each difficulty level
up to the maximum ability of the workers.
This allows a quick lookup of the best possible profit for any worker's ability,
ensuring efficient assignment of workers to jobs.

- **Precomputation of Maximum Profits:** The solution first builds a list to store the maximum-profit achievable for
  each difficulty level up to the maximum worker ability.
- **Accumulation of Profits:** It ensures that for any difficulty level, the profit reflects the highest possible profit
  up to that level.
  This way, a worker can always find the best job they can perform.
- **Efficient Assignment:** By using the precomputed list, the solution quickly sums up the maximum possible profit for
  each worker based on their ability.

---

#### Code Walkthrough {id="code-walkthrough_d2_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

1. **Initialization:**
    - `max_ability = max(worker)`: Finds the maximum ability among all workers.
      This is the highest difficulty level we need to consider.
    - `max_profit_per_diff = [0] * (max_ability + 1)`: Creates a list to store the maximum-profit achievable for each
      difficulty level from 0 to `max_ability`.
      It's initialized with zeros.

2. **Build Maximum Profit per Difficulty:**
    - `for diff, prof in zip(difficulty, profit)`: Iterates through each job's difficulty (`diff`) and profit (`prof`).
    - `if diff <= max_ability`: Checks if the current job's difficulty is within the range of worker abilities we need
      to consider.
    - `max_profit_per_diff[diff] = max(max_profit_per_diff[diff], prof)`: Updates the maximum profit for the current
      job's difficulty level if the current job offers a higher profit.

3. **Accumulate Maximum Profit:**
    - `for index in range(1, max_ability + 1)`: Iterates through each difficulty level from 1 to `max_ability`.
    - `max_profit_per_diff[index] = max(max_profit_per_diff[index], max_profit_per_diff[index - 1])`: Updates the
      maximum profit for the current difficulty level to be the maximum of either its current value or the maximum
      profit of the previous difficulty level.
      This ensures that even if a job has a lower difficulty, it can still be chosen if it offers a higher profit.

4. **Result Calculation/Return:**
    - `sum(max_profit_per_diff[ability] for ability in worker)`: Iterates through each worker's ability and sums up
      their maximum achievable profits based on the precomputed `max_profit_per_diff` list.

#### Example {id="example_d2_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Input:**

```python
difficulty = [5, 12, 2, 6, 15, 7, 9]
profit = [10, 30, 20, 25, 50, 35, 40]
worker = [10, 5, 7, 12, 8]
```

**Step-by-Step Walkthrough:**

1. **Initialization:**
    - The function starts by finding the maximum ability of the workers: `max_ability = max(worker)`, which is `12`.
    - An array `max_profit_per_diff` of size `max_ability + 1` is initialized to store the maximum profit for each
      difficulty level up to `max_ability`: `max_profit_per_diff = [0] * (max_ability + 1)`.

2. **Main Loop (Building Max Profit Array):**

    - **Iteration 1:**
        - **Current Job:** (difficulty = 5, profit = 10)
        - Since `5 <= 12`, update `max_profit_per_diff[5]`: `0 -> 10`.

    - **Iteration 2:**
        - **Current Job:** (difficulty = 12, profit = 30)
        - Since `12 <= 12`, update `max_profit_per_diff[12]`: `0 -> 30`.

    - **Iteration 3:**
        - **Current Job:** (difficulty = 2, profit = 20)
        - Since `2 <= 12`, update `max_profit_per_diff[2]`: `0 -> 20`.

    - **Iteration 4:**
        - **Current Job:** (difficulty = 6, profit = 25)
        - Since `6 <= 12`, update `max_profit_per_diff[6]`: `0 -> 25`.

    - **Iteration 5:**
        - **Current Job:** (difficulty = 15, profit = 50)
        - Since `15 > 12`, skip this job.

    - **Iteration 6:**
        - **Current Job:** (difficulty = 7, profit = 35)
        - Since `7 <= 12`, update `max_profit_per_diff[7]`: `0 -> 35`.

    - **Iteration 7:**
        - **Current Job:** (difficulty = 9, profit = 40)
        - Since `9 <= 12`, update `max_profit_per_diff[9]`: `0 -> 40`.

   **Iteration Summary:**

   ```
   max_profit_per_diff: [0, 0, 20, 0, 0, 10, 25, 35, 0, 40, 0, 0, 30]
   ```

3. **Second Loop (Propagating Maximum Profits):**

    - **Iteration 1/12:**
        - Here we update the maximum profit for each difficulty level based on the previous level's maximum profit.
        - Update `max_profit_per_diff[1]`: `0 -> 0`.

    - **Iteration 2/12:**
        - Since the previous maximum profit is `0`, the maximum profit for `2` remains `20`.
        - Update `max_profit_per_diff[2]`: `20 -> 20`.

    - **Iteration 3/12:**
        - Since the previous maximum profit is `20` and this level's profit is `0`, the maximum profit for `3` gets
          updated to `20`.
        - Update `max_profit_per_diff[3]`: `0 -> 20`.

    - **Iteration 4/12 - 12/12:**
        - The loop continues, updating the maximum profit for each difficulty level based on the previous level's
          maximum profit.

    - The final updated `max_profit_per_diff` array is:
        ```
        max_profit_per_diff: [0, 0, 20, 20, 20, 20, 25, 35, 35, 40, 40, 40, 40]
        ```

4. **Result Calculation/Final Steps:**

    - **Worker 1:**
        - **Ability:** 10
        - **Maximum Profit:** 40
        - **Current Total Profit:** `0 + 40 = 40`

    - **Worker 2:**
        - **Ability:** 5
        - **Maximum Profit:** 20
        - **Current Total Profit:** `40 + 20 = 60`

    - **Worker 3:**
        - **Ability:** 7
        - **Maximum Profit:** 35
        - **Current Total Profit:** `60 + 35 = 95`

    - **Worker 4:**
        - **Ability:** 12
        - **Maximum Profit:** 40
        - **Current Total Profit:** `95 + 40 = 135`

    - **Worker 5:**
        - **Ability:** 8
        - **Maximum Profit:** 35
        - **Current Total Profit:** `135 + 35 = 170`

    - The function returns the total maximum profit of `170`.

---

#### Complexity Analysis {id="complexity-analysis_d2_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Time Complexity:**

- $O(n + m + \text{max\_ability})$, where:
    - $n$ is the length of `difficulty` and `profit` (number of jobs)
    - $m$ is the length of `worker` (number of workers)
    - $\text{max\_ability}$ is the maximum value in `worker`

This is because the algorithm iterates over `difficulty` and `profit` once $(O(n))$, over the range of possible
abilities $(O(\text{max\_ability})$, and over `worker` once $(O(m))$.

**Space Complexity:**

- $O(\text{max\_ability})$

This is because the algorithm uses a list `max_profit_per_diff` to store maximum profits per difficulty level up to
the maximum ability.
The size of this list is directly proportional to `max_ability`.

### Approach 2: Binary Search {id="approach_d2_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

```Python
def maxProfitAssignment2(difficulty: List[int], profit: List[int],
                         worker: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the maximum total profit that workers can achieve based
    on their abilities and the given jobs' difficulties and profits.

    This function first sorts the jobs by difficulty while pairing each
    job with its corresponding profit. It then processes these sorted
    jobs to create a list where each job entry holds the highest profit
    available up to that difficulty level. This transformation ensures
    that for any worker's ability, we can quickly find the best possible
    profit they can achieve using binary search. Since we are dealing
    with a tuple of (difficulty, profit), the binary search is performed
    on the difficulty values, and the other value (profit) is used with
    'float('inf')' as the upper bound for the binary search. This way,
    we ensure that `bisect_right` will find the index where a worker's
    ability can be inserted in the sorted job list with the highest
    profit available up to that difficulty. We subtract 1 to get the
    index of the highest-paying job the worker can perform. By summing up
    the maximum achievable profits for all workers, the function computes
    the total maximum profit.

    The time complexity of this solution is O((n + m) log n), where `n`
    is the number of jobs, and `m` is the number of workers. This is
    because sorting the jobs takes O(n log n) and each worker's job search
    takes O(log n) due to binary search, repeated `m` times; hence, the
    total time complexity is O(n log n + m log n) = O((n + m) log n).
    The space complexity is O(n) for storing the processed job list.
    """
    jobs = sorted(zip(difficulty, profit))

    # Transform the job list to ensure each job entry reflects the
    # highest profit up to that difficulty level
    max_profit_so_far = 0
    for index, job in enumerate(jobs):
        max_profit_so_far = max(max_profit_so_far, job[1])
        jobs[index] = (job[0], max_profit_so_far)

    total_profit = 0
    for ability in worker:
        # Use binary search to find the highest-profit job that the
        # worker can do
        index = bisect_right(jobs, (ability, float('inf')))
        if index > 0:
            total_profit += jobs[index - 1][1]

    return total_profit
```

#### Understanding the Core Idea {id="core-idea_d2_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

The central concept of this solution is to leverage sorting and binary search to efficiently match workers to the most
profitable jobs they can perform.
The solution transforms the job list to reflect the highest profit available up to each difficulty level,
enabling quick lookups.

- **Sorting Jobs by Difficulty:** The jobs are sorted by difficulty to facilitate binary search and cumulative-profit
  calculations.
- **Cumulative-Profit Calculation:** A transformation is applied to the sorted jobs to ensure each job entry reflects
  the highest profit up to that difficulty level.
- **Binary Search for Worker Assignment:** For each worker, a binary search is used to quickly find the highest-paying
  job they can perform.

#### Code Walkthrough {id="code-walkthrough_d2_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

1. **Initialization:**
    - `jobs = sorted(zip(difficulty, profit))`: Creates a list of tuples where each tuple contains the difficulty and
      profit of a job.
      It then sorts this list in ascending order based on the difficulty.

2. **Job Transformation:**
    - `max_profit_so_far = 0`: Initializes a variable to keep track of the maximum profit seen so far.
    - `for index, job in enumerate(jobs)`: Iterates over the sorted jobs.
        - `max_profit_so_far = max(max_profit_so_far, job[1])`: Updates `max_profit_so_far` if the current job has a
          higher profit.
        - `jobs[index] = (job[0], max_profit_so_far)`: Replaces the profit in the current job tuple
          with `max_profit_so_far`.
          This transformation ensures that for each job, the profit stored in the tuple represents the maximum profit
          achievable up to that job's difficulty level.

3. **Profit Calculation:**
    - `total_profit = 0`: Initializes the total profit earned by all workers.
    - `for ability in worker`: Iterates over the abilities of each worker.
        - `index = bisect_right(jobs, (ability, float('inf')))`: Performs a binary search to find the rightmost index in
          the `jobs` list where the tuple (ability, infinity) would be inserted while maintaining the sorted order.
          This essentially finds the index of the first job with a difficulty greater than the worker's ability.
        - `if index > 0`: Checks if the worker is qualified for at least one job.
            - `total_profit += jobs[index - 1][1]`: If the worker is qualified, add the profit of the highest-paying job
              they can do (located at `index - 1`) to the total profit.

4. **Result Calculation/Return:**
    - Returns the calculated `total_profit`.

---

#### Example {id="example_d2_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Input:**

```Python
difficulty = [5, 12, 2, 6, 15, 7, 9]
profit = [10, 30, 20, 25, 50, 35, 40]
worker = [10, 5, 7, 12, 8]
```

**Step-by-Step Walkthrough:**

1. **Initialization:**

    - The `jobs` list is created by pairing corresponding `difficulty` and `profit` values and then sorting them in
      ascending order based on difficulty: `[(2, 20), (5, 10), (6, 25), (7, 35), (9, 40), (12, 30), (15, 50)]`.
    - A variable `max_profit_so_far` is initialized to 0.
      It will track the highest profit encountered as the jobs are processed.

2. **Main Loop (Transforming Jobs with Max Profit):**

    - The loop iterates through each job in the sorted `jobs` list.
    - **Iteration 1:**
        - Job: (2, 20)
        - `max_profit_so_far` is updated to 20 (max of 0 and 20).
        - The job in `jobs` is replaced with (2, 20).
    - **Iteration 2:**
        - Job: (5, 10)
        - `max_profit_so_far` remains 20.
        - The job in `jobs` is replaced with (5, 20).
    - **Iterations 3-7:** Similar logic is applied to the remaining jobs.
      `max_profit_so_far` gets updated as needed, ensuring that the profit associated with each job represents the
      maximum profit achievable up to that difficulty level.

3. **Iteration Summary (Transformed Jobs):**
    - The provided table illustrates how the `jobs` list is transformed during the main loop.
      The "Max Profit So Far" column shows how this value is tracked and used to update the profit component of each
      job.

   | Iteration | Original Job | Max Profit So Far | Updated Job |
            |-----------|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
   | 1         | (2, 20)      | 20                | (2, 20)     |
   | 2         | (5, 10)      | 20                | (5, 20)     |
   | 3         | (6, 25)      | 25                | (6, 25)     |
   | 4         | (7, 35)      | 35                | (7, 35)     |
   | 5         | (9, 40)      | 40                | (9, 40)     |
   | 6         | (12, 30)     | 40                | (12, 40)    |
   | 7         | (15, 50)     | 50                | (15, 50)    |

4. **Calculating Total Profit (Worker Loop):**

    - The loop iterates through the `worker` list.
    - **Iteration 1 (Worker with ability 10):**
        - Binary search (`bisect_right`) is used to find the rightmost job in `jobs` with a difficulty less than or
          equal to the worker's ability (10).
          This leads to index 5.
        - Since the index is greater than 0, the profit of the job at index 4 is added to `total_profit` (40).
    - **Iteration 2 (Worker with ability 5):**
        - Binary search finds index 2.
        - The profit of the job at index 1 (20) is added to `total_profit`. The total profit is now 60.
    - **Iteration 3 (Worker with ability 7):**
        - Binary search finds index 4.
        - The profit of the job at index 3 (35) is added to `total_profit`. The total profit is now 95.
    - **Iteration 4
        - Binary search finds index 6.
        - The profit of the job at index 5 (40) is added to `total_profit`. The total profit is now 135.
    - **Iteration 5
        - Binary search finds index 4.
        - The profit of the job at index 3 (35) is added to `total_profit`. The total profit is now 170.

5. **Final Result:**

    - The function returns the calculated `total_profit`, which is 170 in this example.
      This represents the maximum achievable profit by assigning the workers to the available jobs.

#### Complexity Analysis {id="complexity-analysis_d2_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Time Complexity:**

- $O((n+m) \log n)$, where:
    - $n$ is the number of jobs
    - $m$ is the number of workers

This is because the algorithm:

- Sorts the jobs: $O(n \log n)$
- Transforms the job list: $O(n)$
- Performs binary search for each worker: $O(m \log n)$

**Space Complexity:**

- $O(n)$

This is because the algorithm uses additional space for the `jobs` list which has the same length as the input lists
`difficulty` and `profit`.

{collapsible="true" default-state="expanded" collapsed-title="Two-Pointer Technique Code..."}

#### Understanding the Core Idea {id="core-idea_d2_3" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

The core idea of this solution is to use sorting and a two-pointer technique to efficiently assign the most profitable
jobs to workers based on their abilities.
The solution processes jobs and workers in a sorted order, ensuring that each worker is matched with the best possible
job they can perform.

- **Sorting Jobs and Workers:** Both the jobs and workers are sorted to facilitate efficient traversal and profit
  calculation.
- **Two-Pointer Technique:** The solution uses a two-pointer technique to iterate through the sorted job list and keep
  track of the maximum profit available up to the current worker's ability.
  This technique ensures that the solution only processes each job and worker once, contributing to its efficiency.
- **Accumulating Profits:** By maintaining a running maximum of job profits, the solution ensures that each worker is
  assigned the best possible job they can perform, maximizing total profit.

#### Code Walkthrough {id="code-walkthrough_d2_3" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

1. **Initialization:**
    - `jobs = sorted(zip(difficulty, profit))`: Creates a list of tuples where each tuple contains the difficulty and
      profit of a job.
      It then sorts this list in ascending order based on the difficulty.
    - `total_profit = 0`: Initializes the total profit earned by all workers.
    - `max_profit_so_far = 0`: Initializes a variable to keep track of the maximum profit seen so far for any job within
      the current worker's ability.
    - `index = 0`: Initializes an index to keep track of the current job being considered.

2. **Iterative Profit Calculation:**
    - `for ability in sorted(worker)`: Iterates over the abilities of each worker in ascending order.
        - `while index < len(jobs) and jobs[index][0] <= ability`: This loop continues as long as there are jobs left to
          consider, and the current job's difficulty is less than or equal to the worker's ability.
            - `max_profit_so_far = max(max_profit_so_far, jobs[index][1])`: Updates `max_profit_so_far` if the current
              job has a higher profit than any previously seen job within the worker's ability range.
            - `index += 1`: Moves on to the next job.
        - `total_profit += max_profit_so_far`: Adds the maximum profit achievable by the current worker to
          the `total_profit`.

3. **Result Calculation/Return:**
    - Returns the calculated `total_profit`.

#### Example {id="example_d2_3" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Input:**

```Python
difficulty = [5, 12, 2, 6, 15, 7, 9]
profit = [10, 30, 20, 25, 50, 35, 40]
worker = [10, 5, 7, 12, 8]
```

**Step-by-Step Walkthrough:**

1. **Initialization:**

    - The code combines `difficulty` and `profit` into pairs and sorts them by
      difficulty: `jobs = [(2, 20), (5, 10), (6, 25), (7, 35), (9, 40), (12, 30), (15, 50)]`.
    - The `worker` array is also sorted: `[5, 7, 8, 10, 12]`.
    - `total_profit` is initialized to 0.
    - `max_profit_so_far` (to track the highest profit seen so far) and `index` (to track the current position
      in `jobs`) are both set to 0.

2. **Main Loop (Calculate Total Profit):**

    - The loop iterates over the sorted `worker` array: `worker = [5, 7, 8, 10, 12]`.
    - **Iteration 1 (Worker with ability 5):**
        - Current max_profit_so_far: 0
        - The `while` loop finds the jobs that the worker can do (difficulty <= 5).
            - Job (2, 20) is within the worker's ability. Update `max_profit_so_far` to 20.
            - Job (5, 10) is within the worker's ability. Keep `max_profit_so_far` at 20.
            - Job (6, 25) is not within the worker's ability (difficulty > 5). Exit the loop.
        - The worker's profit (20) is added to `total_profit`, making it 20.
    - **Iteration 2 (Worker with ability 7):**
        - Current max_profit_so_far: 20
        - The `while` loop finds the jobs that the worker can do (up to difficulty 7).
            - Job (6, 25) is within the worker's ability. Update `max_profit_so_far` to 25.
            - Job (7, 35) is within the worker's ability. Update `max_profit_so_far` to 35.
            - Job (9, 40) is not within the worker's ability (difficulty > 7). Exit the loop
        - The worker's profit (35) is added to `total_profit`, making it 55 (20 + 35).
    - **Iteration 3 (Worker with ability 8):**
        - Current max_profit_so_far: 35
        - The `while` loop finds the jobs that the worker can do (up to difficulty 8).
            - Since the worker's ability is 8 and the next job's difficulty is 9, the loop doesn't execute.
        - The worker's profit (35) is added to `total_profit`, making it 90 (55 + 35).
    - **Iteration 4 (Worker with ability 10):**
        - Current max_profit_so_far: 35
        - The `while` loop finds the jobs that the worker can do (up to difficulty 10).
            - Job (9, 40) is within the worker's ability. Update `max_profit_so_far` to 40.
            - Job (12, 30) is not within the worker's ability (difficulty > 10). Exit the loop.
        - The worker's profit (40) is added to `total_profit`, making it 130 (90 + 40).
    - **Iteration 5 (Worker with ability 12):**
        - Current max_profit_so_far: 40
        - The `while` loop finds the jobs that the worker can do (up to difficulty 12).
            - Job (12, 30) is within the worker's ability. Keep `max_profit_so_far` at 40.
            - Job (15, 50) is not within the worker's ability (difficulty > 12). Exit the loop.
        - The worker's profit (40) is added to `total_profit`, making it 170 (130 + 40).

3. **Iteration Summary:**

    - The table demonstrates how `max_profit_so_far` and `total_profit` change with each iteration of the loop.

   | Iteration | Worker Ability | Max Profit So Far | Total Profit |
            |-----------|----------------|-------------------|--------------|
   | 1         | 5              | 20                | 20           |
   | 2         | 7              | 35                | 55           |
   | 3         | 8              | 35                | 90           |
   | 4         | 10             | 40                | 130          |
   | 5         | 12             | 40                | 170          |

4. **Result Calculation/Final Steps:**

    - After the loop completes, the final value of `total_profit` (170) is returned, representing the maximum-profit
      achievable.

#### Complexity Analysis {id="complexity-analysis_d2_3" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Time Complexity:**

- $O(n \log n + m \log m)$, where:
    - $n$ is the number of jobs
    - $m$ is the number of workers

This is because the algorithm:

- Sorts the jobs: $O(n \log n)$
- Sorts the workers: $O(m \log m)$
- Iterates over jobs and workers: While the nested loops might seem like $O(n \cdot m)$, note that the `index` for jobs
  only increases and never goes back.
  So, in total, we iterate over each job and each worker only once, resulting in $O(n + m)$.

Since the sorting operations dominate, the overall time complexity is $O(n \log n + m \log m)$.

**Space Complexity:**

- $O(n)$

This is because the algorithm uses additional space for the `jobs` list which has the same length as the input
lists `difficulty` and `profit` ($2n$ elements).
The space complexity is dominated by the storage of the sorted job list, hence $O(n)$.

## June 19 -> 1482. Minimum Number of Days to Make m Bouquets {collapsible="true" default-state="collapsed"}

You are given an integer array `bloom_day`, an integer `m` and an integer `k`.

You want to make `m` bouquets. To make a bouquet, you need to use `k` **adjacent flowers** from the garden.

The garden consists of `n` flowers, the `ith` flower will bloom in the `bloom_day[i]` and then can be used in **exactly
one** bouquet.

Return *the minimum number of days you need to wait to be able to make* `m` *bouquets from the garden*.
If it is impossible to make m bouquets return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

- **Input:** bloom_day = [1,10,3,10,2], m = 3, k = 1
- **Output:** 3
- **Explanation:**
    - Let us see what happened in the first three days.
      x means flower bloomed and _ means flower did not bloom in the garden.
    - We need three bouquets each should contain one flower.
    - After day 1: [x, _, _, _, _]   // we can only make one bouquet.
    - After day 2: [x, _, _, _, x]   // we can only make two bouquets.
    - After day 3: [x, _, x, _, x]   // we can make three bouquets. The answer is 3.

**Example 2:**

- **Input:** bloom_day = [1,10,3,10,2], m = 3, k = 2
- **Output:** -1
- **Explanation:**
    - We need three bouquets each has two flowers, that means we need six flowers.
      We only have five flowers, so it is impossible to get the needed bouquets, and we return -1.

**Example 3:**

- **Input:** bloom_day = [7,7,7,7,12,7,7], m = 2, k = 3
- **Output:** 12
- **Explanation:**
    - We need two bouquets each should have three flowers.
    - Here is the garden after the 7 and 12 days:
    - After day 7: [x, x, x, x, _, x, x]
    - We can make one bouquet of the first three flowers that bloomed.
      We cannot make another bouquet from the last
      three flowers that bloomed because they are not adjacent.
    - After day 12: [x, x, x, x, x, x, x]
    - It is clear that we can make two bouquets in different ways.

**Constraints:**

- `bloom_day.length == n`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= bloom_day[i] <= 10^9`
- `1 <= m <= 10^6`
- `1 <= k <= n`

### Approach 1.1: Binary Search {id="approach_d3_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

```Python
def minDays1_1(bloom_day: List[int], m: int, k: int) -> int:
    """
    Determines the minimum number of days required to make `m` bouquets
    using `k` adjacent flowers from the garden, given the bloom days of
    the flowers `bloom_day`.

    The function performs a binary search over the range of bloom days
    to find the lowest day value at which it's possible to make the
    required number of bouquets. It first checks if it's possible to
    make the bouquets given the constraint, and then performs binary
    search on the range of bloom days (min(bloom_day) to max(bloom_day))
    to find the earliest day that satisfies the condition. The
    can_make_bouquets` helper function checks if it's possible to make
    the bouquets by a given day by iterating over the bloom_day list and
    counting the number of adjacent flowers that have bloomed by that day.
    The binary search reduces the search space logarithmically, and the
    helper function ensures that the feasibility of making bouquets is
    checked efficiently.

    The time complexity of this solution is O(n log D), where `n` is the
    length of the `bloom_day` list and `D` is the range of bloom days
    (max(bloom_day) - min(bloom_day)). This is because the binary search
    runs in O(log D) time, and each check within the search takes O(n) time.
    The space complexity is O(1) since only a few extra variables are used.
    """
    if k * m > len(bloom_day):
        return -1

    def can_make_bouquets(day: int) -> bool:
        """Helper function to check if `m` bouquets can be made by a given day."""
        bouquet_count = 0
        flowers = 0
        for bloom in bloom_day:
            if bloom <= day:
                flowers += 1
                if flowers == k:
                    bouquet_count += 1
                    if bouquet_count >= m:
                        return True
                    flowers = 0
            else:
                flowers = 0

        return bouquet_count >= m

    left_index, right_index = min(bloom_day), max(bloom_day)
    while left_index < right_index:
        mid_index = (left_index + right_index) // 2
        if can_make_bouquets(mid_index):
            right_index = mid_index
        else:
            left_index = mid_index + 1

    return left_index
```

#### Understanding the Core Idea {id="core-idea_d3_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

The solution leverages binary search to efficiently find the minimum number of days required to make `m` bouquets.
It exploits the monotonic property of the problem:
if it's possible to make `m` bouquets after waiting `x` days, it's also possible after waiting `x + 1` days.

- **Binary Search on Days:** The search space is the range of possible days (from the minimum to the maximum bloom day).
  The solution repeatedly checks the midpoint of this range.
- **Bouquet Formation Check:** For each candidate day, the code simulates bouquet formation using adjacent flowers that
  have bloomed by that day.
- **Search Space Reduction:** If enough bouquets can be made, the search space is narrowed to earlier days.
  Otherwise, it's narrowed to later days.

---

#### Code Walkthrough {id="code-walkthrough_d3_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

1. **Base Case Check:** The code first checks if it's even possible to make `m` bouquets with `k` adjacent flowers each,
   given the total number of flowers.
   If not, it returns -1.

2. **`can_make_bouquets(day)` Function:**
    - This function simulates the garden on a given `day`.
    - It iterates through the bloom days of each flower.
    - If a flower has bloomed by the given `day`, it's added to a potential bouquet (`flowers` counter incremented).
    - Once `k` adjacent flowers are found, a bouquet is formed (`bouquet_count` incremented).
    - If `m` or more bouquets are formed, the function immediately returns `True`.
    - If a flower hasn't bloomed, the current potential bouquet is reset (`flowers` set to 0).
    - Finally, the function returns whether `m` or more bouquets were formed.

3. **Binary Search Initialization:**
    - `left_index` starts at the earliest bloom day (minimum of `bloom_day`).
    - `right_index` starts at the latest bloom day (maximum of `bloom_day`).

4. **Binary Search Loop:**
    - The loop continues as long as there is a range of days to explore (`left_index < right_index`).
    - `mid_index` is calculated as the middle of the current range.
    - The `can_make_bouquets` function checks if `m` bouquets can be formed by `mid_index` day.
    - If yes, the answer might be found earlier (or at `mid_index`), so `right_index` is set to `mid_index`.
    - If no, the answer must be later, so `left_index` is set to `mid_index + 1`.

5. **Result:**
    - When the loop ends, `left_index` holds the minimum day when `m` bouquets can be formed.
      This value is returned as the final result.

#### Example {id="example_d3_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Input:** `bloom_day = [3, 2, 4, 9, 10, 4, 3, 4]`, `m = 3`, `k = 2`

**Step-by-Step Walkthrough:**

1. **Initialization:**
    - The function first checks if it's possible to make three bouquets of size 2, given 8 flowers.
      Since 3 * 2 = 6 and 6 <= 8, it's possible, and the function proceeds.
    - The binary search range is initialized:
        - `left_index = 2` (the minimum value in `bloom_day`)
        - `right_index = 10` (the maximum value in `bloom_day`)

2. **Main Loop (Binary Search):**

    - **Iteration 1:**
        - `mid_index = (2 + 10) // 2 = 6`
        - `can_make_bouquets(6)` is called:
            - The function simulates forming bouquets with flowers that bloom by day 6.
            - It finds only two bouquets can be made. (See iteration summary table below)

              | Flower | Bloom Day | Bloom Day <= 6 | Action                         | Flowers | Bouquets (2 size) |
                                       |--------|-----------|----------------|--------------------------------|---------|-------------------|
              | 1      | 3         | Yes            | Increment Flowers              | 1       | 0                 |
              | 2      | 2         | Yes            | Make Bouquet and Reset Flowers | 2       | 1                 |
              | 3      | 4         | Yes            | Increment Flowers              | 1       | 1                 |
              | 4      | 9         | No             | Reset Flowers                  | 0       | 1                 |
              | 5      | 10        | No             | Reset Flowers                  | 0       | 1                 |
              | 6      | 4         | Yes            | Increment Flowers              | 1       | 1                 |
              | 7      | 3         | Yes            | Make Bouquet and Reset Flowers | 2       | 2                 |
              | 8      | 4         | Yes            | Increment Flowers              | 1       | 2                 |

            - Since this is less than `m = 3`, it returns `False`.
        - The binary search range is updated:
            - `left_index = 7` (since we need to look at later bloom days)

    - **Iteration 2:**
        - `mid_index = (7 + 10) // 2 = 8`
        - `can_make_bouquets(8)` is called:
            - The function simulates forming bouquets with flowers that bloom by day 8.
            - It again finds only two bouquets can be made.
              (See the iteration summary table below)

              | Flower | Bloom Day | Bloom Day <= 8 | Action                         | Flowers | Bouquets (2 size) |

              | 7      | 3         | Yes            | Make Bouquet and Reset Flowers | 2       | 2                 |
              | 8      | 4         | Yes            | Increment Flowers              | 1       | 2                 |

            - Since this is less than `m = 3`, it returns `False`.
        - The binary search range is updated:
            - `left_index = 9`

    - **Iteration 3:**
        - `mid_index = (9 + 10) // 2 = 9`
        - `can_make_bouquets(9)` is called:
            - The function simulates forming bouquets with flowers that bloom by day 9.
            - This time, it successfully makes three bouquets.
              (See the iteration summary table below)

            - It returns `True`.
        - The binary search range is updated:
            - `right_index = 9`

3. **Loop Termination:**
    - The loop terminates because `left_index` and `right_index` both become 9.

4. **Binary Search Iteration Summary:**

   | Iteration | Left Index | Right Index | Mid Index | Can Make Bouquets? | Action             |
         |-----------|------------|-------------|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|
   | 1         | 2          | 10          | 6         | No                 | left = mid + 1 (7) |
   | 2         | 7          | 10          | 8         | No                 | left = mid + 1 (9) |
   | 3         | 9          | 10          | 9         | Yes                | right = mid (9)    |

5. **Result Calculation/Final Steps:**
    - The final value of `left_index` is 9, indicating that you need to wait 9 days to make three bouquets.
    - The function returns 9 as the result.

#### Complexity Analysis {id="complexity-analysis_d3_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Time Complexity:**

- $O(n \log D)$, where `n` is the length of `bloom_day` and `D` is the difference between the maximum and minimum bloom
  days.
    - The binary search takes $O(\log(D))$ time to find the minimum number of days.
    - In each iteration, the `can_make_bouquets` function takes $O(n)$ time to simulate the garden.

**Space Complexity:**

- $O(1)$, the solution uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size.
  This is because only a few variables are used to track the indices and counters.

### Approach 1.2: Binary Search on Sorted Set {id="approach_d3_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

```Python
def minDays1_2(bloom_day: List[int], m: int, k: int) -> int:
    """
    Determines the minimum number of days required to make `m` bouquets
    using `k` adjacent flowers from the garden, given the bloom days of
    the flowers `bloom_day`.

    The function leverages a binary search on a sorted list of unique
    bloom days to find the minimum day at which the required number of
    bouquets could be made. While it has a similar structure to the
    `minDays1_1` function, it optimizes the search space by considering
    only the unique bloom days, sorted in advance to potentially reduce
    the number of comparisons needed. The `can_make_bouquets` function
    is also slightly optimized in this version, and instead of resetting
    the flower count immediately after finding k flowers, it continues to
    count potential bouquets from the remaining flowers. As the previous
    version, the binary search reduces the search space logarithmically,
    and the helper function ensures that the feasibility of making bouquets
    is checked efficiently.

    The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n), where `n is the
    length of the bloom_day list. This is because transforming the list to a
    set takes O(n) time, and sorting the unique bloom days takes O(U log U)
    time, where `U` is the number of unique bloom days. The binary search
    runs in O(log U) time, and each check within the search takes O(n) time.
    Since U <= n, the overall time complexity simplifies from
    O(n + U log U + n log U) to O(n log n). The space complexity is O(U),
    which is at most O(n) in the worst case when all bloom days are unique.
    """
    if k * m > len(bloom_day):
        return -1

    def can_make_bouquets(day: int) -> bool:
        """Helper function to check if `m` bouquets can be made by a given day."""
        bouquet_count = 0
        flowers = 0
        for bloom in bloom_day:
            if bloom <= day:
                flowers += 1
            else:
                # Calculate bouquets from accumulated flowers before resetting
                bouquet_count += flowers // k
                if bouquet_count >= m:
                    return True
                flowers = 0
        bouquet_count += flowers // k
        return bouquet_count >= m

    unique_bloom_days = sorted(set(bloom_day))

    left_index, right_index = 0, len(unique_bloom_days) - 1
    while left_index < right_index:
        mid_index = (left_index + right_index) // 2
        if can_make_bouquets(unique_bloom_days[mid_index]):
            right_index = mid_index
        else:
            left_index = mid_index + 1

    return unique_bloom_days[left_index]
```

#### Understanding the Core Idea {id="core-idea_d3_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

This solution builds upon the core idea of binary search like the previous one, but with an optimization focused on the
search space.
Instead of searching within the full range of bloom days (which could be large),
it leverages the fact that only the unique bloom days matter.

- **Binary Search on Unique Bloom Days:** The search space is reduced to the sorted set of unique bloom days.
  This potentially drastically reduces the number of iterations in the binary search.
- **Bouquet Formation Check:** The `can_make_bouquets` function remains largely the same, but it now implicitly handles
  the gaps between bloom days by counting how many bouquets can be formed from the consecutive bloomed flowers.
- **Optimized Search:** The binary search operates on the indices of the sorted unique bloom days, making the
  comparisons more efficient.

---

#### Code Walkthrough {id="code-walkthrough_d3_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

1. **Base Case Check:** Identical to the previous solution, this checks if making `m` bouquets is even possible.

2. **`can_make_bouquets(day)` Function:**
    - The function's logic is slightly modified from the previous version.
    - Instead of resetting `flowers` to 0 whenever a bloom day is exceeded, it now adds the current `flowers` count (
      divided by `k`) to `bouquet_count`.
      This efficiently accounts for all bouquets formed up to the current point.
    - The rest of the logic remains the same: check if enough bouquets are made and return the result.

3. **Unique Bloom Days Preparation:**
    - `unique_bloom_days` is created by:
        - Converting the `bloom_day` list to a set to get unique days.
        - Sorting the set to have a defined order for binary search.

4. **Binary Search Initialization and Loop:**
    - `left_index` and `right_index` are initialized for the indices of `unique_bloom_days`.
    - The loop and its logic remain almost the same as before, but now it operates on the indices
      of `unique_bloom_days`.

5. **Result:**
    - After the loop, `unique_bloom_days[left_index]` gives the minimum bloom day required.

#### Example {id="example_d3_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Input:** `bloom_day = [3, 2, 4, 9, 10, 4, 3, 4]`, `m = 3`, `k = 2`

**Step-by-Step Walkthrough:**

1. **Initialization:**

    - The function first checks if it's possible to make three bouquets of size 2, given 8 flowers.
      Since $3 \cdot 2 = 6$ and $6 <= 8$, it's possible, and the function proceeds.
    - The unique bloom days are extracted and sorted: `unique_bloom_days = [2, 3, 4, 9, 10]`
    - The binary search range is initialized to the indices of `unique_bloom_days`:
        - `left_index = 0` (the first index)
        - `right_index = 4` (the last index)

2. **Main Loop (Binary Search):**

    - **Iteration 1:**
        - `mid_index = (0 + 4) // 2 = 2`
        - `can_make_bouquets(unique_bloom_days[2])`, which is `can_make_bouquets(4)`, is called:
            - The function simulates forming bouquets with flowers that bloom by day 4.
            - It finds that only two bouquets can be made. (See iteration summary table below)

              | Flower | Bloom Day | Bloom Day <= 4 | Action                           | Flowers | Bouquets (2 size) |
                                                 |--------|-----------|----------------|----------------------------------|---------|-------------------|
              | 1      | 3         | Yes            | Increment Flowers                | 1       | 0                 |
              | 2      | 2         | Yes            | Increment Flowers                | 2       | 0                 |
              | 3      | 4         | Yes            | Increment Flowers                | 3       | 0                 |
              | 4      | 9         | No             | Reset Flowers/Calculate Bouquets | 0       | 1                 |
              | 5      | 10        | No             | Reset Flowers/Calculate Bouquets | 0       | 1                 |
              | 6      | 4         | Yes            | Increment Flowers                | 1       | 1                 |
              | 7      | 3         | Yes            | Increment Flowers                | 2       | 1                 |
              | 8      | 4         | Yes            | Final Bouquet Calculation        | 3       | 2                 |

            - Since this is less than `m = 3`, it returns `False`.
        - The binary search range is updated:
            - `left_index = 3` (since we need to look at later bloom days)

    - **Iteration 2:**
        - `mid_index = (3 + 4) // 2 = 3`
        - `can_make_bouquets(unique_bloom_days[3])`, which is `can_make_bouquets(9)`, is called:
            - The function simulates forming bouquets with flowers that bloom by day 9.
            - This time, it successfully makes three bouquets. (See iteration summary table below)

          | Flower | Bloom Day | Bloom Day <= 9 | Action                           | Flowers | Bouquets (2 size) |
                           |--------|-----------|----------------|----------------------------------|---------|-------------------|
          | 1      | 3         | Yes            | Increment Flowers                | 1       | 0                 |
          | 2      | 2         | Yes            | Increment Flowers                | 2       | 0                 |
          | 3      | 4         | Yes            | Increment Flowers                | 3       | 0                 |
          | 4      | 9         | Yes            | Increment Flowers                | 4       | 0                 |
          | 5      | 10        | No             | Reset Flowers/Calculate Bouquets | 0       | 2                 |
          | 6      | 4         | Yes            | Increment Flowers                | 1       | 2                 |
          | 7      | 3         | Yes            | Increment Flowers                | 2       | 2                 |
          | 8      | 4         | Yes            | Final Bouquet Calculation        | 3       | 3                 |

            - It returns `True`.
        - The binary search range is updated:
            - `right_index = 3`

3. **Loop Termination:**

    - The loop terminates because `left_index` and `right_index` both become 3.

4. **Binary Search Iteration Summary:**

   | Iteration | Left Index | Right Index | Mid Index | Can Make Bouquets? | Action             |
         |-----------|------------|-------------|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|
   | 1         | 0          | 4           | 2         | No                 | left = mid + 1 (3) |
   | 2         | 3          | 4           | 3         | Yes                | right = mid (3)    |

5. **Result Calculation/Final Steps:**
    - The final value of `left_index` is 3.
    - The function returns `unique_bloom_days[3]`, which is `9`, indicating that you need to wait 9 days to make three
      bouquets.

#### Complexity Analysis {id="complexity-analysis_d3_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Time Complexity:**

- $O(n \log(n))$, where `n` is the length of `bloom_day`.
  This is an improvement over the previous $O(n \log(D))$ in cases where there are many repeated bloom days.
    - Creating the set takes $O(n)$ time, and sorting it takes $O(u \log(u))$, where `u` is the number of unique bloom
      days.
    - The binary search now takes $O(\log(u))$ iterations.
    - Each iteration of `can_make_bouquets` still takes $O(n)$ time.
    - In total, we have $O(n + u \log(u) + n \log(u))$.

Since $u <= n$, the overall time complexity simplifies to $O(n \log(n))$.

**Space Complexity:**

- $O(u)$ in the worst case, to store the set of unique bloom days.
  This is potentially much better than the previous $O(n)$ if there are many repeated values.
  If `u` is small compared to `n`, it can be considered $O(1)$.
