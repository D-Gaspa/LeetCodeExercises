## June 17 -> 633. Sum of Square Numbers {collapsible="true" default-state="collapsed"}

Given a non-negative integer `c`, decide whether there are two integers `a` and `b` such that `a^2 + b^2 = c`.

**Example 1:**

- **Input:** c = 5
- **Output:** true
- **Explanation:** 1 * 1 + 2 * 2 = 5

**Example 2:**

- **Input:** c = 3
- **Output:** false

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= c <= 2^31 - 1`

```Python
def judgeSquareSum1(c: int) -> bool:
    """
    Determines if a given non-negative integer 'c' can be expressed as
    the sum of squares of two integers 'a' and 'b'.

    The function uses a two-pointer technique starting from 0 and the
    square root of 'c'. It iteratively checks the sum of squares of
    the two pointers, 'start_index' and 'end_index'. If the sum is
    less than 'c', it increases 'start_index' to get a larger sum.
    If the sum is greater than 'c', it decreases 'end_index' to get
    a smaller sum. If the sum is equal to 'c', the function returns
    True as it has found the pair of numbers. If no such pair is found
    after the loop, it returns False. This approach works because if
    there exist two numbers 'a' and 'b' such that a^2 + b^2 = c, then
    'a' and 'b' must each be less than or equal to sqrt(c).

    The time complexity of this function is O(√c) because, in the
    worst case, the while loop iterates up to the square root of 'c' times.
    The space complexity is O(1) as it uses a constant amount of extra space.

#### Understanding the Core Idea {id="core-idea_d1_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

The core idea of this solution is to find if the given integer `c` can be decomposed into the sum of two perfect squares
using a two-pointer approach.
Here's the breakdown of the concept:

- **Two-Pointer Approach:**
    - The function initializes two pointers: `start_index` at 0 and `end_index` at the square root of `c`.
      These pointers represent potential values of 'a' and 'b'.
    - In each iteration, it calculates the `squares_sum` of the squares of these pointers.
    - If `squares_sum` equals `c`, it means we've found a pair of integers (a, b) whose squares add up to `c`.
    - If `squares_sum` is less than `c`, we increment `start_index` to increase the sum (since a^2 is the smaller term).
    - If `squares_sum` is greater than `c`, we decrement `end_index` to decrease the sum (since b^2 is the larger term).

- **Mathematical Basis:**
    - The algorithm is based on the fact that if a number `c` can be expressed as the sum of two squares, the
      numbers `a` and `b` must each be less than or equal to the square root of `c`.
      This ensures we only check relevant values.

> **Key Insights:**
>
> **Sorted Search Space:** The potential values of `a` and `b` that we check are inherently sorted due to the nature of
> squares.
> This allows us to efficiently narrow down the search space.
>
> **Early Termination:** If we find a match, we can return `True` immediately.
> If `start_index` crosses `end_index`, there's no need to continue searching.

#### Code Walkthrough {id="code-walkthrough_d1_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

1. **Initialization:**
    - `start_index` is set to 0, representing the smallest possible square.
    - `end_index` is set to the integer part of the square root of `c`, representing the largest possible square within
      the range.

2. **Main Loop (Two-Pointer Search):**
    - The `while` loop runs as long as `start_index` is less than or equal to `end_index`.
    - In each iteration:
        - `squares_sum` is calculated as `start_index * start_index + end_index * end_index`.
        - **Decision Point (Conditional Statements):**
            - If `squares_sum == c`, the function returns `True` (pair found).
            - If `squares_sum < c`, we increase `start_index` by 1.
            - If `squares_sum > c`, we decrease `end_index` by 1.

3. **Result Calculation/Return:**
    - If the loop completes without finding a match, the function returns `False` (no pair exists).

#### Example {id="example_d1_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Input:** `c = 98`

**Step-by-Step Walkthrough:**

1. **Initialization:**
    - `start_index` is set to 0.
    - `end_index` is set to the integer part of the square root of 98, which is 9.

2. **Main Loop (Two-Pointer Search):**

    - **While $0 \leq 9$ (Iteration 1):**
        - `squares_sum` = $0^2 + 9^2 = 81$
        - Since 81 < 98, we increment `start_index` to 1.

    - **While $1 \leq 9$ (Iteration 2):**
        - `squares_sum` = $1^2 + 9^2 = 82$
        - Since 82 < 98, we increment `start_index` to 2.

    - **While $2 \leq 9$ (Iteration 3):**
        - `squares_sum` = $2^2 + 9^2 = 85$
        - Since 85 < 98, we increment `start_index` to 3.

    - **While $3 \leq 9$ (Iteration 4):**
        - `squares_sum` = $3^2 + 9^2 = 90$
        - Since 90 < 98, we increment `start_index` to 4.

    - **While $4 \leq 9$ (Iteration 5):**
        - `squares_sum` = $4^2 + 9^2 = 97$
        - Since 97 < 98, we increment `start_index` to 5.

    - **While $5 \leq 9$ (Iteration 6):**
        - `squares_sum` = $5^2 + 9^2 = 106$
        - Since 106 > 98, we decrement `end_index` to 8.

    - **While $5 \leq 8$ (Iteration 7):**
        - `squares_sum` = $5^2 + 8^2 = 89$
        - Since 89 < 98, we increment `start_index` to 6.

    - **While $6 \leq 8$ (Iteration 8):**
        - `squares_sum` = $6^2 + 8^2 = 100$
        - Since 100 > 98, we decrement `end_index` to 7.

    - **While $6 \leq 7$ (Iteration 9):**
        - `squares_sum` = $6^2 + 7^2 = 85$
        - Since 85 < 98, we increment `start_index` to 7.

    - **While $7 \leq 7$ (Iteration 10):**
        - `squares_sum` = $7^2 + 7^2 = 98$
        - Since 98 == 98, we have found a valid pair (7, 7), and the function returns `True`.

3. **Loop Termination:** The loop terminates when `squares_sum == c`, indicating a valid pair of integers has been
   found.

4. **Iteration Summary:**

   | `start_index` | `end_index` | `squares_sum` | Comparison | Action             |
                           |---------------|-------------|---------------|------------|--------------------|
   | 0             | 9           | 81            | 81 < 98    | `start_index += 1` |
   | 1             | 9           | 82            | 82 < 98    | `start_index += 1` |
   | 2             | 9           | 85            | 85 < 98    | `start_index += 1` |
   | 3             | 9           | 90            | 90 < 98    | `start_index += 1` |
   | 4             | 9           | 97            | 97 < 98    | `start_index += 1` |
   | 5             | 9           | 106           | 106 > 98   | `end_index -= 1`   |
   | 5             | 8           | 89            | 89 < 98    | `start_index += 1` |
   | 6             | 8           | 100           | 100 > 98   | `end_index -= 1`   |
   | 6             | 7           | 85            | 85 < 98    | `start_index += 1` |
   | 7             | 7           | 98            | 98 == 98   | Return True        |

5. **Result Calculation/Final Steps:**
    - The function directly returns `True` as soon as it finds the valid pair (7, 7).
      It does not need to calculate or return any additional values.
    - The pair (7, 7) satisfies the condition $7^2 + 7^2 = 98$, confirming that 98 can be expressed as the sum of two
      squares.

#### Complexity Analysis {id="complexity-analysis_d1_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Time Complexity:**

- $O(\sqrt{c})$ where $c$ is the input integer.
  In the worst case, the `while` loop will run up to the square root of $c$ times.

**Space Complexity:**

- $O(1)$ (Constant): The algorithm uses only a fixed number of variables (`start_index`, `end_index`, `squares_sum`),
  and this number doesn't grow with the input size.

    The function iterates through possible prime factors up to the

#### Understanding the Core Idea {id="core-idea_d1_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

The core idea of this solution is to leverage Fermat's Theorem on sums of two squares to determine if a given number
can be expressed as such.
Fermat's theorem states:

> An integer greater than one can be written as a sum of two squares if and only if its prime decomposition contains
> no prime congruent to 3 (mod 4) raised to an odd power.
>
{style="info"}

In simpler terms, a number can be expressed as the sum of two squares unless it has a prime factor of the form $4k + 3$
(such as 3, 7, 11, etc.) that appears an odd number of times in its prime factorization.

This is because a prime of the form $4k + 3$ cannot be expressed as the sum of two squares
(as opposed to primes of the form $4k + 1$ which can always be expressed as the sum of two squares).
When a prime of the form $4k + 3$ appears with an even exponent in the prime factorization of $c$,
its contribution to the overall sum of squares can be paired off and effectively neutralized.
However, if such a prime appears with an odd exponent, it cannot be paired off,
and its presence fundamentally prevents $c$ from being expressed as the sum of two squares.
This is because the square of any number is congruent to 0 or 1 (mod 4), but never 3.

Another important concept is the Brahmagupta-Fibonacci identity, which states that the product of two sums of two
squares is itself a sum of two squares.
This property allows us to combine the squares of two numbers to form a new sum of squares:

$$
(a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2) = (ac - bd)^2 + (ad + bc)^2
$$

This identity is crucial in the context of Fermat's theorem and the decomposition of numbers into sums of squares.
When a prime factor $p$ of the form $4k + 3$ appears with an even exponent,
it can be paired off to form a new sum of squares: $p^{2k} = (p^k)^2 + (0)^2$, and this can be combined with other
sums of squares to form a larger sum of squares.
However, if $p$ appears with an odd exponent, it cannot be paired off.
The number cannot be expressed as a sum of squares due to the presence of the lone $p$ term
(which is congruent to 3 mod 4).

- **Prime Factorization:** The solution systematically checks for prime factors of $c$ up to its square root.
- **Counting Divisibility:** For each prime factor, it counts how many times it divides $c$ evenly (tracked
  by `divisors_count`).
- **Checking Fermat's Condition:** If a prime factor of the form $4k + 3$ has an odd `divisors_count`, the number cannot
  be a sum of squares (returns `False`).
- **Base Case:** After iterating through smaller primes, the remaining value of $c$ is either 1 or a prime.
  It checks if this remaining prime is of the form $4k + 3$.
  If it is, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.

#### Code Walkthrough {id="code-walkthrough_d1_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

1. **Initialization:**
    - `index` is initialized to 2, the smallest prime number.

2. **Main Loop (Checking Prime Factors):**
    - The `while` loop iterates as long as the square of `index` (potential prime factor) is less than or equal to `c`.
    - **Inner Loop (Counting Divisors):**
        - If `c` is divisible by `index`, a nested `while` loop repeatedly divides `c` by `index` to count its
          occurrences.
    - **Decision Points (Fermat's Condition):**
        - After the inner loop, it checks if `divisors_count` is odd (indicating an odd power) and if `index` is of the
          form `4k + 3`.
          If both are true, the function returns `False`.

3. **Base Case (After Main Loop):**
    - If the main loop completes without returning, `c` is either 1 or a prime.
    - It checks if the remaining `c` is of the form `4k + 3`. If so, it returns `False`; otherwise, `True`.

#### Example {id="example_d1_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Input:** `c = 98`

**Step-by-Step Walkthrough:**

1. **Initialization:**
    - `index` is initialized to 2, the smallest prime number.

2. **Main Loop (Checking Prime Factors):**

    - **While $2 \times 2 = 4 \leq 98$ (Iteration 1):**
        - `index = 2`
        - `c` is divisible by `index` (98 % 2 == 0).
        - Inner loop counts the divisors: `divisors_count = 1`, `c = 49` (after division)
        - `divisors_count` is 1 and `index` (2) is not of the form 4k+3, so the loop continues.
        - `index` is incremented to 3.

    - **While $3 \times 3 = 9 \leq 49$ (Iteration 2):**
        - `index = 3`
        - `c` is not divisible by `index` (49 % 3 != 0), so the loop continues.
        - `index` is incremented to 4.

    - **While $4 \times 4 = 16 \leq 49$ (Iteration 3):**
        - `index = 4`
        - `c` is not divisible by `index` (49 % 4 != 0), so the loop continues.
        - `index` is incremented to 5.

    - **While $5 \times 5 = 25 \leq 49$ (Iteration 4):**
        - `index = 5`
        - `c` is not divisible by `index` (49 % 5 != 0), so the loop continues.
        - `index` is incremented to 6.

    - **While $6 \times 6 = 36 \leq 49$ (Iteration 5):**
        - `index = 6`
        - `c` is not divisible by `index` (49 % 6 != 0), so the loop continues.
        - `index` is incremented to 7.

    - **While $7 \times 7 = 49 \leq 49$ (Iteration 6):**
        - `index = 7`
        - `c` is divisible by `index` (49 % 7 == 0).
        - Inner loop counts the divisors:
            - `divisors_count = 1`, `c = 7`
            - `divisors_count = 2`, `c = 1`
        - `index` (7) is of the form 4k+3, but since `divisors_count` is even (2), the loop continues.
        - `index` is incremented to 8.

3. **Loop Termination:** The loop terminates after iteration 6 because `index * index` (64) is not less than or equal to
   the current value of `c` (1).

4. **Iteration Summary/Visual Aids:**

   | `c` | `index` | `divisors_count` | `index % 4 == 3` | Result                   |
                           |-----|---------|------------------|------------------|--------------------------|
   | 108 | 2       | 1                | False            | Continue                 |
   | 49  | 3       | 0                | False            | Continue                 |
   | 49  | 4       | 0                | False            | Continue                 |
   | 49  | 5       | 0                | False            | Continue                 |
   | 49  | 6       | 0                | False            | Continue                 |
   | 49  | 7       | 2                | True             | Continue (Even exponent) |

5. **Result Calculation/Final Steps:**
    - After the loop, `c` is 1. Since 1 is not of the form 4k + 3, the function returns `True`, indicating that 98 can
      be expressed as the sum of two squares $(7^2 + 7^2 = 98)$.

6. **Visualizing the Pairing of Squares:**
    - Since the factorization of 98 is $2 \cdot 7^2$, the prime factor 7 (of the form $4k + 3$) appears with an even
      exponent (2), allowing it to be paired off and expressed as a sum of squares.
    - This can be visualized using the Brahmagupta-Fibonacci identity to combine the squares of 7 into a new sum of
      squares:
        - We know that $2 = 1^2 + 1^2$, and we can express $7^2$ as $7^2 + 0^2$.
          With the factorization, we get the product of these two sums of squares:
            - $(1^2 + 1^2) \cdot (7^2 + 0^2) = 98$.
        - Using the identity, we can combine these to get $(1 \cdot 7 - 1 \cdot 0)^2 + (1 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 7)^2 = 7^2 +
          7^2 = 98$.

**Time Complexity:**

- $O(\sqrt{c} \log c)$.
  The main loop runs up to $\sqrt{c}$ times.
  For each iteration, the inner loop might run up to $\log c$ times in the worst case

**Space Complexity:**

- $O(1)$ (Constant): The algorithm uses a fixed number of variables (`index`, `divisors_count`, `c`), regardless of the

## June 18 -> 826. Most Profit Assigning Work {collapsible="true" default-state="collapsed"}

You have `n` jobs and `m` workers. You are given three arrays: `difficulty`, `profit`, and `worker` where:

- `difficulty[i]` and `profit[i]` are the difficulty and the profit of the `ith` job, and
- `worker[j]` is the ability of `jth` worker (i.e., the `jth` worker can only complete a job with difficulty at
  most `worker[j]`).

Every worker can be assigned **at most one job**, but one job can be **completed multiple times**.

- For example, if three workers attempt the same job that pays 1 dollar, then the total profit will be 3 dollars.
  If a worker cannot complete any job, their profit is `$0`.

Return the maximum profit we can achieve after assigning the workers to the jobs.

**Example 1:**

- **Input:** difficulty = [2,4,6,8,10], profit = [10,20,30,40,50], worker = [4,5,6,7]
- **Output:** 100
- **Explanation:**
    - Workers are assigned jobs of difficulty [4,4,6,6], and they get a profit of [20,20,30,30] separately.

**Example 2:**

- **Input:** difficulty = [85,47,57], profit = [24,66,99], worker = [40,25,25]
- **Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

- `n == difficulty.length`
- `n == profit.length`
- `m == worker.length`
- `1 <= n, m <= 10^4`
- `1 <= difficulty[i], profit[i], worker[i] <= 10^5`

```Python
def maxProfitAssignment1(difficulty: List[int], profit: List[int],
                         worker: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the maximum total profit that workers can achieve based
    on their abilities and the given jobs' difficulties and profits.

    The function first determines the maximum ability of all workers,
    then initializes a list to store the maximum profit for each level
    of difficulty up to this maximum ability. By iterating through
    each job's difficulty and profit, it updates this list to ensure
    it captures the highest profit available for each difficulty level
    up to the maximum ability. The function then adjusts this list so
    that for any given difficulty, it reflects the highest-profit
    achievable up to that difficulty level, because a job with a lower
    difficulty may have a higher profit. Finally, it sums up the highest

#### Understanding the Core Idea {id="core-idea_d2_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

The core idea of this solution is to leverage a precomputed list of maximum profits achievable for each difficulty level
up to the maximum ability of the workers.
This allows a quick lookup of the best possible profit for any worker's ability,
ensuring efficient assignment of workers to jobs.

- **Precomputation of Maximum Profits:** The solution first builds a list to store the maximum-profit achievable for
  each difficulty level up to the maximum worker ability.
- **Accumulation of Profits:** It ensures that for any difficulty level, the profit reflects the highest possible profit
  up to that level.
  This way, a worker can always find the best job they can perform.
- **Efficient Assignment:** By using the precomputed list, the solution quickly sums up the maximum possible profit for
  each worker based on their ability.

---

#### Code Walkthrough {id="code-walkthrough_d2_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

1. **Initialization:**
    - `max_ability = max(worker)`: Finds the maximum ability among all workers.
      This is the highest difficulty level we need to consider.
    - `max_profit_per_diff = [0] * (max_ability + 1)`: Creates a list to store the maximum-profit achievable for each
      difficulty level from 0 to `max_ability`.
      It's initialized with zeros.

2. **Build Maximum Profit per Difficulty:**
    - `for diff, prof in zip(difficulty, profit)`: Iterates through each job's difficulty (`diff`) and profit (`prof`).
    - `if diff <= max_ability`: Checks if the current job's difficulty is within the range of worker abilities we need
      to consider.
    - `max_profit_per_diff[diff] = max(max_profit_per_diff[diff], prof)`: Updates the maximum profit for the current
      job's difficulty level if the current job offers a higher profit.

3. **Accumulate Maximum Profit:**
    - `for index in range(1, max_ability + 1)`: Iterates through each difficulty level from 1 to `max_ability`.
    - `max_profit_per_diff[index] = max(max_profit_per_diff[index], max_profit_per_diff[index - 1])`: Updates the
      maximum profit for the current difficulty level to be the maximum of either its current value or the maximum
      profit of the previous difficulty level.
      This ensures that even if a job has a lower difficulty, it can still be chosen if it offers a higher profit.

4. **Result Calculation/Return:**
    - `sum(max_profit_per_diff[ability] for ability in worker)`: Iterates through each worker's ability and sums up
      their maximum achievable profits based on the precomputed `max_profit_per_diff` list.

#### Example {id="example_d2_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Input:**

```python
difficulty = [5, 12, 2, 6, 15, 7, 9]
profit = [10, 30, 20, 25, 50, 35, 40]
worker = [10, 5, 7, 12, 8]
```

**Step-by-Step Walkthrough:**

1. **Initialization:**
    - The function starts by finding the maximum ability of the workers: `max_ability = max(worker)`, which is `12`.
    - An array `max_profit_per_diff` of size `max_ability + 1` is initialized to store the maximum profit for each
      difficulty level up to `max_ability`: `max_profit_per_diff = [0] * (max_ability + 1)`.

2. **Main Loop (Building Max Profit Array):**

    - **Iteration 1:**
        - **Current Job:** (difficulty = 5, profit = 10)
        - Since `5 <= 12`, update `max_profit_per_diff[5]`: `0 -> 10`.

    - **Iteration 2:**
        - **Current Job:** (difficulty = 12, profit = 30)
        - Since `12 <= 12`, update `max_profit_per_diff[12]`: `0 -> 30`.

    - **Iteration 3:**
        - **Current Job:** (difficulty = 2, profit = 20)
        - Since `2 <= 12`, update `max_profit_per_diff[2]`: `0 -> 20`.

    - **Iteration 4:**
        - **Current Job:** (difficulty = 6, profit = 25)
        - Since `6 <= 12`, update `max_profit_per_diff[6]`: `0 -> 25`.

    - **Iteration 5:**
        - **Current Job:** (difficulty = 15, profit = 50)
        - Since `15 > 12`, skip this job.

    - **Iteration 6:**
        - **Current Job:** (difficulty = 7, profit = 35)
        - Since `7 <= 12`, update `max_profit_per_diff[7]`: `0 -> 35`.

    - **Iteration 7:**
        - **Current Job:** (difficulty = 9, profit = 40)
        - Since `9 <= 12`, update `max_profit_per_diff[9]`: `0 -> 40`.

   **Iteration Summary:**

   ```
   max_profit_per_diff: [0, 0, 20, 0, 0, 10, 25, 35, 0, 40, 0, 0, 30]
   ```

3. **Second Loop (Propagating Maximum Profits):**

    - **Iteration 1/12:**
        - Here we update the maximum profit for each difficulty level based on the previous level's maximum profit.
        - Update `max_profit_per_diff[1]`: `0 -> 0`.

    - **Iteration 2/12:**
        - Since the previous maximum profit is `0`, the maximum profit for `2` remains `20`.
        - Update `max_profit_per_diff[2]`: `20 -> 20`.

    - **Iteration 3/12:**
        - Since the previous maximum profit is `20` and this level's profit is `0`, the maximum profit for `3` gets
          updated to `20`.
        - Update `max_profit_per_diff[3]`: `0 -> 20`.

    - **Iteration 4/12 - 12/12:**
        - The loop continues, updating the maximum profit for each difficulty level based on the previous level's
          maximum profit.

    - The final updated `max_profit_per_diff` array is:
        ```
        max_profit_per_diff: [0, 0, 20, 20, 20, 20, 25, 35, 35, 40, 40, 40, 40]
        ```

4. **Result Calculation/Final Steps:**

    - **Worker 1:**
        - **Ability:** 10
        - **Maximum Profit:** 40
        - **Current Total Profit:** `0 + 40 = 40`

    - **Worker 2:**
        - **Ability:** 5
        - **Maximum Profit:** 20
        - **Current Total Profit:** `40 + 20 = 60`

    - **Worker 3:**
        - **Ability:** 7
        - **Maximum Profit:** 35
        - **Current Total Profit:** `60 + 35 = 95`

    - **Worker 4:**
        - **Ability:** 12
        - **Maximum Profit:** 40
        - **Current Total Profit:** `95 + 40 = 135`

    - **Worker 5:**
        - **Ability:** 8
        - **Maximum Profit:** 35
        - **Current Total Profit:** `135 + 35 = 170`

    - The function returns the total maximum profit of `170`.

---

#### Complexity Analysis {id="complexity-analysis_d2_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Time Complexity:**

- $O(n + m + \text{max\_ability})$, where:
    - $n$ is the length of `difficulty` and `profit` (number of jobs)
    - $m$ is the length of `worker` (number of workers)
    - $\text{max\_ability}$ is the maximum value in `worker`

This is because the algorithm iterates over `difficulty` and `profit` once $(O(n))$, over the range of possible
abilities $(O(\text{max\_ability})$, and over `worker` once $(O(m))$.

**Space Complexity:**

- $O(\text{max\_ability})$

This is because the algorithm uses a list `max_profit_per_diff` to store maximum profits per difficulty level up to
the maximum ability.
The size of this list is directly proportional to `max_ability`.

### Approach 2: Binary Search {id="approach_d2_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

```Python
def maxProfitAssignment2(difficulty: List[int], profit: List[int],
                         worker: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the maximum total profit that workers can achieve based
    on their abilities and the given jobs' difficulties and profits.

    This function first sorts the jobs by difficulty while pairing each
    job with its corresponding profit. It then processes these sorted
    jobs to create a list where each job entry holds the highest profit
    available up to that difficulty level. This transformation ensures
    that for any worker's ability, we can quickly find the best possible
    profit they can achieve using binary search. Since we are dealing
    with a tuple of (difficulty, profit), the binary search is performed
    on the difficulty values, and the other value (profit) is used with
    'float('inf')' as the upper bound for the binary search. This way,
    we ensure that `bisect_right` will find the index where a worker's
    ability can be inserted in the sorted job list with the highest
    profit available up to that difficulty. We subtract 1 to get the
    index of the highest-paying job the worker can perform. By summing up
    the maximum achievable profits for all workers, the function computes
    the total maximum profit.

    The time complexity of this solution is O((n + m) log n), where `n`
    is the number of jobs, and `m` is the number of workers. This is
    because sorting the jobs takes O(n log n) and each worker's job search
    takes O(log n) due to binary search, repeated `m` times; hence, the
    total time complexity is O(n log n + m log n) = O((n + m) log n).
    The space complexity is O(n) for storing the processed job list.
    """
    jobs = sorted(zip(difficulty, profit))

    # Transform the job list to ensure each job entry reflects the
    # highest profit up to that difficulty level
    max_profit_so_far = 0
    for index, job in enumerate(jobs):
        max_profit_so_far = max(max_profit_so_far, job[1])
        jobs[index] = (job[0], max_profit_so_far)

    total_profit = 0
    for ability in worker:
        # Use binary search to find the highest-profit job that the
        # worker can do
        index = bisect_right(jobs, (ability, float('inf')))
        if index > 0:
            total_profit += jobs[index - 1][1]

    return total_profit
```

#### Understanding the Core Idea {id="core-idea_d2_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

The central concept of this solution is to leverage sorting and binary search to efficiently match workers to the most
profitable jobs they can perform.
The solution transforms the job list to reflect the highest profit available up to each difficulty level,
enabling quick lookups.

- **Sorting Jobs by Difficulty:** The jobs are sorted by difficulty to facilitate binary search and cumulative-profit
  calculations.
- **Cumulative-Profit Calculation:** A transformation is applied to the sorted jobs to ensure each job entry reflects
  the highest profit up to that difficulty level.
- **Binary Search for Worker Assignment:** For each worker, a binary search is used to quickly find the highest-paying
  job they can perform.

#### Code Walkthrough {id="code-walkthrough_d2_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

1. **Initialization:**
    - `jobs = sorted(zip(difficulty, profit))`: Creates a list of tuples where each tuple contains the difficulty and
      profit of a job.
      It then sorts this list in ascending order based on the difficulty.

2. **Job Transformation:**
    - `max_profit_so_far = 0`: Initializes a variable to keep track of the maximum profit seen so far.
    - `for index, job in enumerate(jobs)`: Iterates over the sorted jobs.
        - `max_profit_so_far = max(max_profit_so_far, job[1])`: Updates `max_profit_so_far` if the current job has a
          higher profit.
        - `jobs[index] = (job[0], max_profit_so_far)`: Replaces the profit in the current job tuple
          with `max_profit_so_far`.
          This transformation ensures that for each job, the profit stored in the tuple represents the maximum profit
          achievable up to that job's difficulty level.

3. **Profit Calculation:**
    - `total_profit = 0`: Initializes the total profit earned by all workers.
    - `for ability in worker`: Iterates over the abilities of each worker.
        - `index = bisect_right(jobs, (ability, float('inf')))`: Performs a binary search to find the rightmost index in
          the `jobs` list where the tuple (ability, infinity) would be inserted while maintaining the sorted order.
          This essentially finds the index of the first job with a difficulty greater than the worker's ability.
        - `if index > 0`: Checks if the worker is qualified for at least one job.
            - `total_profit += jobs[index - 1][1]`: If the worker is qualified, add the profit of the highest-paying job
              they can do (located at `index - 1`) to the total profit.

4. **Result Calculation/Return:**
    - Returns the calculated `total_profit`.

---

#### Example {id="example_d2_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Input:**

```Python
difficulty = [5, 12, 2, 6, 15, 7, 9]
profit = [10, 30, 20, 25, 50, 35, 40]
worker = [10, 5, 7, 12, 8]
```

**Step-by-Step Walkthrough:**

1. **Initialization:**

    - The `jobs` list is created by pairing corresponding `difficulty` and `profit` values and then sorting them in
      ascending order based on difficulty: `[(2, 20), (5, 10), (6, 25), (7, 35), (9, 40), (12, 30), (15, 50)]`.
    - A variable `max_profit_so_far` is initialized to 0.
      It will track the highest profit encountered as the jobs are processed.

2. **Main Loop (Transforming Jobs with Max Profit):**

    - The loop iterates through each job in the sorted `jobs` list.
    - **Iteration 1:**
        - Job: (2, 20)
        - `max_profit_so_far` is updated to 20 (max of 0 and 20).
        - The job in `jobs` is replaced with (2, 20).
    - **Iteration 2:**
        - Job: (5, 10)
        - `max_profit_so_far` remains 20.
        - The job in `jobs` is replaced with (5, 20).
    - **Iterations 3-7:** Similar logic is applied to the remaining jobs.
      `max_profit_so_far` gets updated as needed, ensuring that the profit associated with each job represents the
      maximum profit achievable up to that difficulty level.

3. **Iteration Summary (Transformed Jobs):**
    - The provided table illustrates how the `jobs` list is transformed during the main loop.
      The "Max Profit So Far" column shows how this value is tracked and used to update the profit component of each
      job.

   | Iteration | Original Job | Max Profit So Far | Updated Job |
                           |-----------|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
   | 1         | (2, 20)      | 20                | (2, 20)     |
   | 2         | (5, 10)      | 20                | (5, 20)     |
   | 3         | (6, 25)      | 25                | (6, 25)     |
   | 4         | (7, 35)      | 35                | (7, 35)     |
   | 5         | (9, 40)      | 40                | (9, 40)     |
   | 6         | (12, 30)     | 40                | (12, 40)    |
   | 7         | (15, 50)     | 50                | (15, 50)    |

4. **Calculating Total Profit (Worker Loop):**

    - The loop iterates through the `worker` list.
    - **Iteration 1 (Worker with ability 10):**
        - Binary search (`bisect_right`) is used to find the rightmost job in `jobs` with a difficulty less than or
          equal to the worker's ability (10).
          This leads to index 5.
        - Since the index is greater than 0, the profit of the job at index 4 is added to `total_profit` (40).
    - **Iteration 2 (Worker with ability 5):**
        - Binary search finds index 2.
        - The profit of the job at index 1 (20) is added to `total_profit`. The total profit is now 60.
    - **Iteration 3 (Worker with ability 7):**
        - Binary search finds index 4.
        - The profit of the job at index 3 (35) is added to `total_profit`. The total profit is now 95.
    - **Iteration 4
        - Binary search finds index 6.
        - The profit of the job at index 5 (40) is added to `total_profit`. The total profit is now 135.
    - **Iteration 5
        - Binary search finds index 4.
        - The profit of the job at index 3 (35) is added to `total_profit`. The total profit is now 170.

5. **Final Result:**

    - The function returns the calculated `total_profit`, which is 170 in this example.
      This represents the maximum achievable profit by assigning the workers to the available jobs.

#### Complexity Analysis {id="complexity-analysis_d2_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Time Complexity:**

- $O((n+m) \log n)$, where:
    - $n$ is the number of jobs
    - $m$ is the number of workers

This is because the algorithm:

- Sorts the jobs: $O(n \log n)$
- Transforms the job list: $O(n)$
- Performs binary search for each worker: $O(m \log n)$

**Space Complexity:**

- $O(n)$

This is because the algorithm uses additional space for the `jobs` list which has the same length as the input lists
`difficulty` and `profit`.

{collapsible="true" default-state="expanded" collapsed-title="Two-Pointer Technique Code..."}

#### Understanding the Core Idea {id="core-idea_d2_3" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

The core idea of this solution is to use sorting and a two-pointer technique to efficiently assign the most profitable
jobs to workers based on their abilities.
The solution processes jobs and workers in a sorted order, ensuring that each worker is matched with the best possible
job they can perform.

- **Sorting Jobs and Workers:** Both the jobs and workers are sorted to facilitate efficient traversal and profit
  calculation.
- **Two-Pointer Technique:** The solution uses a two-pointer technique to iterate through the sorted job list and keep
  track of the maximum profit available up to the current worker's ability.
  This technique ensures that the solution only processes each job and worker once, contributing to its efficiency.
- **Accumulating Profits:** By maintaining a running maximum of job profits, the solution ensures that each worker is
  assigned the best possible job they can perform, maximizing total profit.

#### Code Walkthrough {id="code-walkthrough_d2_3" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

1. **Initialization:**
    - `jobs = sorted(zip(difficulty, profit))`: Creates a list of tuples where each tuple contains the difficulty and
      profit of a job.
      It then sorts this list in ascending order based on the difficulty.
    - `total_profit = 0`: Initializes the total profit earned by all workers.
    - `max_profit_so_far = 0`: Initializes a variable to keep track of the maximum profit seen so far for any job within
      the current worker's ability.
    - `index = 0`: Initializes an index to keep track of the current job being considered.

2. **Iterative Profit Calculation:**
    - `for ability in sorted(worker)`: Iterates over the abilities of each worker in ascending order.
        - `while index < len(jobs) and jobs[index][0] <= ability`: This loop continues as long as there are jobs left to
          consider, and the current job's difficulty is less than or equal to the worker's ability.
            - `max_profit_so_far = max(max_profit_so_far, jobs[index][1])`: Updates `max_profit_so_far` if the current
              job has a higher profit than any previously seen job within the worker's ability range.
            - `index += 1`: Moves on to the next job.
        - `total_profit += max_profit_so_far`: Adds the maximum profit achievable by the current worker to
          the `total_profit`.

3. **Result Calculation/Return:**
    - Returns the calculated `total_profit`.

#### Example {id="example_d2_3" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Input:**

```Python
difficulty = [5, 12, 2, 6, 15, 7, 9]
profit = [10, 30, 20, 25, 50, 35, 40]
worker = [10, 5, 7, 12, 8]
```

**Step-by-Step Walkthrough:**

1. **Initialization:**

    - The code combines `difficulty` and `profit` into pairs and sorts them by
      difficulty: `jobs = [(2, 20), (5, 10), (6, 25), (7, 35), (9, 40), (12, 30), (15, 50)]`.
    - The `worker` array is also sorted: `[5, 7, 8, 10, 12]`.
    - `total_profit` is initialized to 0.
    - `max_profit_so_far` (to track the highest profit seen so far) and `index` (to track the current position
      in `jobs`) are both set to 0.

2. **Main Loop (Calculate Total Profit):**

    - The loop iterates over the sorted `worker` array: `worker = [5, 7, 8, 10, 12]`.
    - **Iteration 1 (Worker with ability 5):**
        - Current max_profit_so_far: 0
        - The `while` loop finds the jobs that the worker can do (difficulty <= 5).
            - Job (2, 20) is within the worker's ability. Update `max_profit_so_far` to 20.
            - Job (5, 10) is within the worker's ability. Keep `max_profit_so_far` at 20.
            - Job (6, 25) is not within the worker's ability (difficulty > 5). Exit the loop.
        - The worker's profit (20) is added to `total_profit`, making it 20.
    - **Iteration 2 (Worker with ability 7):**
        - Current max_profit_so_far: 20
        - The `while` loop finds the jobs that the worker can do (up to difficulty 7).
            - Job (6, 25) is within the worker's ability. Update `max_profit_so_far` to 25.
            - Job (7, 35) is within the worker's ability. Update `max_profit_so_far` to 35.
            - Job (9, 40) is not within the worker's ability (difficulty > 7). Exit the loop
        - The worker's profit (35) is added to `total_profit`, making it 55 (20 + 35).
    - **Iteration 3 (Worker with ability 8):**
        - Current max_profit_so_far: 35
        - The `while` loop finds the jobs that the worker can do (up to difficulty 8).
            - Since the worker's ability is 8 and the next job's difficulty is 9, the loop doesn't execute.
        - The worker's profit (35) is added to `total_profit`, making it 90 (55 + 35).
    - **Iteration 4 (Worker with ability 10):**
        - Current max_profit_so_far: 35
        - The `while` loop finds the jobs that the worker can do (up to difficulty 10).
            - Job (9, 40) is within the worker's ability. Update `max_profit_so_far` to 40.
            - Job (12, 30) is not within the worker's ability (difficulty > 10). Exit the loop.
        - The worker's profit (40) is added to `total_profit`, making it 130 (90 + 40).
    - **Iteration 5 (Worker with ability 12):**
        - Current max_profit_so_far: 40
        - The `while` loop finds the jobs that the worker can do (up to difficulty 12).
            - Job (12, 30) is within the worker's ability. Keep `max_profit_so_far` at 40.
            - Job (15, 50) is not within the worker's ability (difficulty > 12). Exit the loop.
        - The worker's profit (40) is added to `total_profit`, making it 170 (130 + 40).

3. **Iteration Summary:**

    - The table demonstrates how `max_profit_so_far` and `total_profit` change with each iteration of the loop.

   | Iteration | Worker Ability | Max Profit So Far | Total Profit |
                           |-----------|----------------|-------------------|--------------|
   | 1         | 5              | 20                | 20           |
   | 2         | 7              | 35                | 55           |
   | 3         | 8              | 35                | 90           |
   | 4         | 10             | 40                | 130          |
   | 5         | 12             | 40                | 170          |

4. **Result Calculation/Final Steps:**

    - After the loop completes, the final value of `total_profit` (170) is returned, representing the maximum-profit
      achievable.

#### Complexity Analysis {id="complexity-analysis_d2_3" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Time Complexity:**

- $O(n \log n + m \log m)$, where:
    - $n$ is the number of jobs
    - $m$ is the number of workers

This is because the algorithm:

- Sorts the jobs: $O(n \log n)$
- Sorts the workers: $O(m \log m)$
- Iterates over jobs and workers: While the nested loops might seem like $O(n \cdot m)$, note that the `index` for jobs
  only increases and never goes back.
  So, in total, we iterate over each job and each worker only once, resulting in $O(n + m)$.

Since the sorting operations dominate, the overall time complexity is $O(n \log n + m \log m)$.

**Space Complexity:**

- $O(n)$

This is because the algorithm uses additional space for the `jobs` list which has the same length as the input
lists `difficulty` and `profit` ($2n$ elements).
The space complexity is dominated by the storage of the sorted job list, hence $O(n)$.

## June 19 -> 1482. Minimum Number of Days to Make m Bouquets {collapsible="true" default-state="collapsed"}

You are given an integer array `bloom_day`, an integer `m` and an integer `k`.

You want to make `m` bouquets. To make a bouquet, you need to use `k` **adjacent flowers** from the garden.

The garden consists of `n` flowers, the `ith` flower will bloom in the `bloom_day[i]` and then can be used in **exactly
one** bouquet.

Return *the minimum number of days you need to wait to be able to make* `m` *bouquets from the garden*.
If it is impossible to make m bouquets return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

- **Input:** bloom_day = [1,10,3,10,2], m = 3, k = 1
- **Output:** 3
- **Explanation:**
    - Let us see what happened in the first three days.
      x means flower bloomed and _ means flower did not bloom in the garden.
    - We need three bouquets each should contain one flower.
    - After day 1: [x, _, _, _, _]   // we can only make one bouquet.
    - After day 2: [x, _, _, _, x]   // we can only make two bouquets.
    - After day 3: [x, _, x, _, x]   // we can make three bouquets. The answer is 3.

**Example 2:**

- **Input:** bloom_day = [1,10,3,10,2], m = 3, k = 2
- **Output:** -1
- **Explanation:**
    - We need three bouquets each has two flowers, that means we need six flowers.
      We only have five flowers, so it is impossible to get the needed bouquets, and we return -1.

**Example 3:**

- **Input:** bloom_day = [7,7,7,7,12,7,7], m = 2, k = 3
- **Output:** 12
- **Explanation:**
    - We need two bouquets each should have three flowers.
    - Here is the garden after the 7 and 12 days:
    - After day 7: [x, x, x, x, _, x, x]
    - We can make one bouquet of the first three flowers that bloomed.
      We cannot make another bouquet from the last
      three flowers that bloomed because they are not adjacent.
    - After day 12: [x, x, x, x, x, x, x]
    - It is clear that we can make two bouquets in different ways.

**Constraints:**

- `bloom_day.length == n`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= bloom_day[i] <= 10^9`
- `1 <= m <= 10^6`
- `1 <= k <= n`

### Approach 1.1: Binary Search {id="approach_d3_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

```Python
def minDays1_1(bloom_day: List[int], m: int, k: int) -> int:
    """
    Determines the minimum number of days required to make `m` bouquets
    using `k` adjacent flowers from the garden, given the bloom days of
    the flowers `bloom_day`.

    The function performs a binary search over the range of bloom days
    to find the lowest day value at which it's possible to make the
    required number of bouquets. It first checks if it's possible to
    make the bouquets given the constraint, and then performs binary
    search on the range of bloom days (min(bloom_day) to max(bloom_day))
    to find the earliest day that satisfies the condition. The
    can_make_bouquets` helper function checks if it's possible to make
    the bouquets by a given day by iterating over the bloom_day list and
    counting the number of adjacent flowers that have bloomed by that day.
    The binary search reduces the search space logarithmically, and the
    helper function ensures that the feasibility of making bouquets is
    checked efficiently.

    The time complexity of this solution is O(n log D), where `n` is the
    length of the `bloom_day` list and `D` is the range of bloom days
    (max(bloom_day) - min(bloom_day)). This is because the binary search
    runs in O(log D) time, and each check within the search takes O(n) time.
    The space complexity is O(1) since only a few extra variables are used.
    """
    if k * m > len(bloom_day):
        return -1

    def can_make_bouquets(day: int) -> bool:
        """Helper function to check if `m` bouquets can be made by a given day."""
        bouquet_count = 0
        flowers = 0
        for bloom in bloom_day:
            if bloom <= day:
                flowers += 1
                if flowers == k:
                    bouquet_count += 1
                    if bouquet_count >= m:
                        return True
                    flowers = 0
            else:
                flowers = 0

        return bouquet_count >= m

    left_index, right_index = min(bloom_day), max(bloom_day)
    while left_index < right_index:
        mid_index = (left_index + right_index) // 2
        if can_make_bouquets(mid_index):
            right_index = mid_index
        else:
            left_index = mid_index + 1

    return left_index
```

#### Understanding the Core Idea {id="core-idea_d3_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

The solution leverages binary search to efficiently find the minimum number of days required to make `m` bouquets.
It exploits the monotonic property of the problem:
if it's possible to make `m` bouquets after waiting `x` days, it's also possible after waiting `x + 1` days.

- **Binary Search on Days:** The search space is the range of possible days (from the minimum to the maximum bloom day).
  The solution repeatedly checks the midpoint of this range.
- **Bouquet Formation Check:** For each candidate day, the code simulates bouquet formation using adjacent flowers that
  have bloomed by that day.
- **Search Space Reduction:** If enough bouquets can be made, the search space is narrowed to earlier days.
  Otherwise, it's narrowed to later days.

---

#### Code Walkthrough {id="code-walkthrough_d3_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

1. **Base Case Check:** The code first checks if it's even possible to make `m` bouquets with `k` adjacent flowers each,
   given the total number of flowers.
   If not, it returns -1.

2. **`can_make_bouquets(day)` Function:**
    - This function simulates the garden on a given `day`.
    - It iterates through the bloom days of each flower.
    - If a flower has bloomed by the given `day`, it's added to a potential bouquet (`flowers` counter incremented).
    - Once `k` adjacent flowers are found, a bouquet is formed (`bouquet_count` incremented).
    - If `m` or more bouquets are formed, the function immediately returns `True`.
    - If a flower hasn't bloomed, the current potential bouquet is reset (`flowers` set to 0).
    - Finally, the function returns whether `m` or more bouquets were formed.

3. **Binary Search Initialization:**
    - `left_index` starts at the earliest bloom day (minimum of `bloom_day`).
    - `right_index` starts at the latest bloom day (maximum of `bloom_day`).

4. **Binary Search Loop:**
    - The loop continues as long as there is a range of days to explore (`left_index < right_index`).
    - `mid_index` is calculated as the middle of the current range.
    - The `can_make_bouquets` function checks if `m` bouquets can be formed by `mid_index` day.
    - If yes, the answer might be found earlier (or at `mid_index`), so `right_index` is set to `mid_index`.
    - If no, the answer must be later, so `left_index` is set to `mid_index + 1`.

5. **Result:**
    - When the loop ends, `left_index` holds the minimum day when `m` bouquets can be formed.
      This value is returned as the final result.

#### Example {id="example_d3_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Input:** `bloom_day = [3, 2, 4, 9, 10, 4, 3, 4]`, `m = 3`, `k = 2`

**Step-by-Step Walkthrough:**

1. **Initialization:**
    - The function first checks if it's possible to make three bouquets of size 2, given 8 flowers.
      Since 3 * 2 = 6 and 6 <= 8, it's possible, and the function proceeds.
    - The binary search range is initialized:
        - `left_index = 2` (the minimum value in `bloom_day`)
        - `right_index = 10` (the maximum value in `bloom_day`)

2. **Main Loop (Binary Search):**

    - **Iteration 1:**
        - `mid_index = (2 + 10) // 2 = 6`
        - `can_make_bouquets(6)` is called:
            - The function simulates forming bouquets with flowers that bloom by day 6.
            - It finds only two bouquets can be made. (See iteration summary table below)

              | Flower | Bloom Day | Bloom Day <= 6 | Action                         | Flowers | Bouquets (2 size) |
                                                                                                             |--------|-----------|----------------|--------------------------------|---------|-------------------|

              | 2      | 2         | Yes            | Make Bouquet and Reset Flowers | 2       | 1                 |

              | 4      | 9         | No             | Reset Flowers                  | 0       | 1                 |
              | 5      | 10        | No             | Reset Flowers                  | 0       | 1                 |
              | 6      | 4         | Yes            | Increment Flowers              | 1       | 1                 |

            - Since this is less than `m = 3`, it returns `False`.
        - The binary search range is updated:
            - `left_index = 7` (since we need to look at later bloom days)

    - **Iteration 2:**
        - `mid_index = (7 + 10) // 2 = 8`
        - `can_make_bouquets(8)` is called:
            - The function simulates forming bouquets with flowers that bloom by day 8.
            - It again finds only two bouquets can be made.
              (See the iteration summary table below)

            - Since this is less than `m = 3`, it returns `False`.
        - The binary search range is updated:
            - `left_index = 9`

    - **Iteration 3:**
        - `mid_index = (9 + 10) // 2 = 9`
        - `can_make_bouquets(9)` is called:
            - The function simulates forming bouquets with flowers that bloom by day 9.
            - This time, it successfully makes three bouquets.
              (See the iteration summary table below)

              | Flower | Bloom Day | Bloom Day <= 9 | Action                         | Flowers | Bouquets (2 size) |

            - It returns `True`.
        - The binary search range is updated:
            - `right_index = 9`

3. **Loop Termination:**
    - The loop terminates because `left_index` and `right_index` both become 9.

4. **Binary Search Iteration Summary:**

   | 3         | 9          | 10          | 9         | Yes                | right = mid (9)    |

5. **Result Calculation/Final Steps:**
    - The final value of `left_index` is 9, indicating that you need to wait 9 days to make three bouquets.
    - The function returns 9 as the result.

#### Complexity Analysis {id="complexity-analysis_d3_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Time Complexity:**

- $O(n \log D)$, where `n` is the length of `bloom_day` and `D` is the difference between the maximum and minimum bloom
  days.
    - The binary search takes $O(\log(D))$ time to find the minimum number of days.
    - In each iteration, the `can_make_bouquets` function takes $O(n)$ time to simulate the garden.

**Space Complexity:**

- $O(1)$, the solution uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size.
  This is because only a few variables are used to track the indices and counters.

### Approach 1.2: Binary Search on Sorted Set {id="approach_d3_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

```Python
def minDays1_2(bloom_day: List[int], m: int, k: int) -> int:
    """
    Determines the minimum number of days required to make `m` bouquets
    using `k` adjacent flowers from the garden, given the bloom days of
    the flowers `bloom_day`.

    The function leverages a binary search on a sorted list of unique
    bloom days to find the minimum day at which the required number of
    bouquets could be made. While it has a similar structure to the
    `minDays1_1` function, it optimizes the search space by considering
    only the unique bloom days, sorted in advance to potentially reduce
    the number of comparisons needed. The `can_make_bouquets` function
    is also slightly optimized in this version, and instead of resetting
    the flower count immediately after finding k flowers, it continues to
    count potential bouquets from the remaining flowers. As the previous
    version, the binary search reduces the search space logarithmically,
    and the helper function ensures that the feasibility of making bouquets
    is checked efficiently.

    The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n), where `n is the
    length of the bloom_day list. This is because transforming the list to a
    set takes O(n) time, and sorting the unique bloom days takes O(U log U)
    time, where `U` is the number of unique bloom days. The binary search
    runs in O(log U) time, and each check within the search takes O(n) time.
    Since U <= n, the overall time complexity simplifies from
    O(n + U log U + n log U) to O(n log n). The space complexity is O(U),
    which is at most O(n) in the worst case when all bloom days are unique.
    """
    if k * m > len(bloom_day):
        return -1

    def can_make_bouquets(day: int) -> bool:
        """Helper function to check if `m` bouquets can be made by a given day."""
        bouquet_count = 0
        flowers = 0
        for bloom in bloom_day:
            if bloom <= day:
                flowers += 1
            else:
                # Calculate bouquets from accumulated flowers before resetting
                bouquet_count += flowers // k
                if bouquet_count >= m:
                    return True
                flowers = 0
        bouquet_count += flowers // k
        return bouquet_count >= m

    unique_bloom_days = sorted(set(bloom_day))

    left_index, right_index = 0, len(unique_bloom_days) - 1
    while left_index < right_index:
        mid_index = (left_index + right_index) // 2
        if can_make_bouquets(unique_bloom_days[mid_index]):
            right_index = mid_index
        else:
            left_index = mid_index + 1

    return unique_bloom_days[left_index]
```

#### Understanding the Core Idea {id="core-idea_d3_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

This solution builds upon the core idea of binary search like the previous one, but with an optimization focused on the
search space.
Instead of searching within the full range of bloom days (which could be large),
it leverages the fact that only the unique bloom days matter.

- **Binary Search on Unique Bloom Days:** The search space is reduced to the sorted set of unique bloom days.
  This potentially drastically reduces the number of iterations in the binary search.
- **Bouquet Formation Check:** The `can_make_bouquets` function remains largely the same, but it now implicitly handles
  the gaps between bloom days by counting how many bouquets can be formed from the consecutive bloomed flowers.
- **Optimized Search:** The binary search operates on the indices of the sorted unique bloom days, making the
  comparisons more efficient.

---

#### Code Walkthrough {id="code-walkthrough_d3_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

1. **Base Case Check:** Identical to the previous solution, this checks if making `m` bouquets is even possible.

2. **`can_make_bouquets(day)` Function:**
    - The function's logic is slightly modified from the previous version.
    - Instead of resetting `flowers` to 0 whenever a bloom day is exceeded, it now adds the current `flowers` count (
      divided by `k`) to `bouquet_count`.
      This efficiently accounts for all bouquets formed up to the current point.
    - The rest of the logic remains the same: check if enough bouquets are made and return the result.

3. **Unique Bloom Days Preparation:**
    - `unique_bloom_days` is created by:
        - Converting the `bloom_day` list to a set to get unique days.
        - Sorting the set to have a defined order for binary search.

4. **Binary Search Initialization and Loop:**
    - `left_index` and `right_index` are initialized for the indices of `unique_bloom_days`.
    - The loop and its logic remain almost the same as before, but now it operates on the indices
      of `unique_bloom_days`.

5. **Result:**
    - After the loop, `unique_bloom_days[left_index]` gives the minimum bloom day required.

---

#### Example {id="example_d3_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Input:** `bloom_day = [3, 2, 4, 9, 10, 4, 3, 4]`, `m = 3`, `k = 2`

**Step-by-Step Walkthrough:**

1. **Initialization:**

    - The function first checks if it's possible to make three bouquets of size 2, given 8 flowers.
      Since $3 \cdot 2 = 6$ and $6 <= 8$, it's possible, and the function proceeds.
    - The unique bloom days are extracted and sorted: `unique_bloom_days = [2, 3, 4, 9, 10]`
    - The binary search range is initialized to the indices of `unique_bloom_days`:
        - `left_index = 0` (the first index)
        - `right_index = 4` (the last index)

2. **Main Loop (Binary Search):**

    - **Iteration 1:**
        - `mid_index = (0 + 4) // 2 = 2`
        - `can_make_bouquets(unique_bloom_days[2])`, which is `can_make_bouquets(4)`, is called:
            - The function simulates forming bouquets with flowers that bloom by day 4.
            - It finds that only two bouquets can be made. (See iteration summary table below)

              | Flower | Bloom Day | Bloom Day <= 4 | Action                           | Flowers | Bouquets (2 size) |
                                                                                                                       |--------|-----------|----------------|----------------------------------|---------|-------------------|

              | 2      | 2         | Yes            | Increment Flowers                | 2       | 0                 |

              | 4      | 9         | No             | Reset Flowers/Calculate Bouquets | 0       | 1                 |
              | 5      | 10        | No             | Reset Flowers/Calculate Bouquets | 0       | 1                 |
              | 6      | 4         | Yes            | Increment Flowers                | 1       | 1                 |
              | 7      | 3         | Yes            | Increment Flowers                | 2       | 1                 |
              | 8      | 4         | Yes            | Final Bouquet Calculation        | 3       | 2                 |

            - Since this is less than `m = 3`, it returns `False`.
        - The binary search range is updated:
            - `left_index = 3` (since we need to look at later bloom days)

    - **Iteration 2:**
        - `mid_index = (3 + 4) // 2 = 3`
        - `can_make_bouquets(unique_bloom_days[3])`, which is `can_make_bouquets(9)`, is called:
            - The function simulates forming bouquets with flowers that bloom by day 9.
            - This time, it successfully makes three bouquets. (See iteration summary table below)

          | Flower | Bloom Day | Bloom Day <= 9 | Action                           | Flowers | Bouquets (2 size) |
                                                                             |--------|-----------|----------------|----------------------------------|---------|-------------------|

          | 2      | 2         | Yes            | Increment Flowers                | 2       | 0                 |

          | 6      | 4         | Yes            | Increment Flowers                | 1       | 2                 |
          | 7      | 3         | Yes            | Increment Flowers                | 2       | 2                 |
          | 8      | 4         | Yes            | Final Bouquet Calculation        | 3       | 3                 |

            - It returns `True`.
        - The binary search range is updated:
            - `right_index = 3`

3. **Loop Termination:**

    - The loop terminates because `left_index` and `right_index` both become 3.

4. **Binary Search Iteration Summary:**

   | Iteration | Left Index | Right Index | Mid Index | Can Make Bouquets? | Action             |
                        |-----------|------------|-------------|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|
   | 1         | 0          | 4           | 2         | No                 | left = mid + 1 (3) |
   | 2         | 3          | 4           | 3         | Yes                | right = mid (3)    |

5. **Result Calculation/Final Steps:**
    - The final value of `left_index` is 3.
    - The function returns `unique_bloom_days[3]`, which is `9`, indicating that you need to wait 9 days to make three
      bouquets.

---

#### Complexity Analysis {id="complexity-analysis_d3_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Time Complexity:**

- $O(n \log(n))$, where `n` is the length of `bloom_day`.
  This is an improvement over the previous $O(n \log(D))$ in cases where there are many repeated bloom days.
    - Creating the set takes $O(n)$ time, and sorting it takes $O(u \log(u))$, where `u` is the number of unique bloom
      days.
    - The binary search now takes $O(\log(u))$ iterations.
    - Each iteration of `can_make_bouquets` still takes $O(n)$ time.
    - In total, we have $O(n + u \log(u) + n \log(u))$.

Since $u <= n$, the overall time complexity simplifies to $O(n \log(n))$.

**Space Complexity:**

- $O(u)$ in the worst case, to store the set of unique bloom days.
  This is potentially much better than the previous $O(n)$ if there are many repeated values.
  If `u` is small compared to `n`, it can be considered $O(1)$.

## June 20 -> 1552. Magnetic Force Between Two Balls {collapsible="true" default-state="collapsed"}

In the universe Earth C-137, Rick discovered a special form of magnetic force between two balls if they are put in his
new invented basket.
Rick has `n` empty baskets, the `ith` basket is at `position[i]`, Morty has `m` balls and needs
to distribute the balls into the baskets such that the **minimum magnetic force** between any two balls is **maximum**.

Rick stated that magnetic force between two different balls at positions `x` and `y` is `|x - y|`.

Given the integer array `position` and the integer `m`. Return *the required force*.

**Example 1:**

![june20-2024-ex1.png](june20-2024-ex1.png)

- **Input:** position = [1,2,3,4,7], m = 3
- **Output:** 3
- **Explanation:** Distributing the three balls into baskets 1, 4 and 7 will make the magnetic force between ball
  pairs [3, 3, 6].
  The minimum magnetic force is 3. We cannot achieve a larger minimum magnetic force than 3.

**Example 2:**

- **Input:** position = [5,4,3,2,1,1000000000], m = 2
- **Output:** 999999999
- **Explanation:** We can use baskets 1 and 1000000000.

**Constraints:**

- `n == position.length`
- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= position[i] <= 10^9`
- All integers in `position` are **distinct**.
- `2 <= m <= position.length`

---

### Approach 1: Binary Search {id="approach_d4_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

```Python
def maxDistance1(position: List[int], m: int) -> int:
    """
    Determines the maximum possible minimum magnetic force between any
    two balls placed in baskets.

    This function uses a binary search approach to find the optimal
    minimum distance between balls. It first sorts the position list,
    then employs a helper function can_place_balls` to check if it's
    possible to place all `m` balls with a given minimum distance. The
    binary search efficiently narrows down the range of possible distances.

    The search space is defined by the following bounds:
    - Lower Bound (`1`): The minimum possible force is 1, when balls
      are placed in adjacent positions.
    - Upper Bound (`(max(position) - min(position)) // (m - 1)`):
      To maximize the minimum distance, we aim to spread the balls as
      far apart as possible. This upper bound represents the theoretical
      maximum average distance achievable with `m` balls and `m-1` gaps.

    The time complexity of this solution is O(n log(n * range)), where
    `n` is the length of the position list and range is
    `(max(position) - min(position)) / (m - 1)`. This is because we sort
    the position list in O(n log n) time and perform binary search with
    the `can_place_balls` check in O(n log(range)) time, and when combined,
    it results in O(n log(n) + n log(range)) = O(n log(n * range)).
    The space complexity is O(n) due to the sorting operation.

#### Understanding the Core Idea {id="core-idea_d4_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

The central concept of this solution is to leverage binary search to efficiently find the maximum possible minimum
distance between any two balls.
This approach works because the problem has a monotonic property:
if we can place `m` balls with a minimum distance `d`, we can also place them with any distance smaller than `d`.

- **Binary Search on Answer:** Instead of checking all possible distances, we use binary search to narrow down the range
  of potential answers quickly.
- **Greedy Ball Placement:** For each potential minimum distance, we use a greedy approach to place balls as far apart
  as possible.
- **Monotonicity:** The ability to place balls at a given minimum distance implies we can place them at any smaller
  distance, allowing for binary search.

> **Key Insight:**
> The upper bound of the search space is cleverly set to `(max(position) - min(position)) // (m - 1)`,
> which represents the theoretical maximum average distance between balls if they were evenly spread across the entire
> range.

#### Code Walkthrough {id="code-walkthrough_d4_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

1. **Helper Function (`can_place_balls`):**
    - Initializes `remaining_balls` to `m - 1`, representing the number of balls left to place after the first.
    - Sets `next_valid_position` to the first position plus the `min_distance`.
    - Iterates through the remaining positions:
        - If the current position (`pos`) is greater than or equal to `next_valid_position`, a ball is
          placed, `remaining_balls` is decremented, and `next_valid_position` is updated.
        - If all balls are placed (`remaining_balls` becomes 0), it returns `True`.
    - Returns `False` if not all balls could be placed, `True` otherwise.

2. **Initialization:**
    - Sorts the `position` array in ascending order.
    - Initializes the search space with `start_index = 1` (minimum possible force)
      and `end_index = (position[-1] - position[0]) // (m - 1)` (maximum possible average distance rounded down).

3. **Main Loop (Binary Search):**
    - While `start_index < end_index`:
        - Calculates the `mid_index` with a slight bias towards the right to ensure progress.
        - Calls `can_place_balls` with `mid_index` as the minimum distance.
        - If `can_place_balls` returns `True`:
            - Updates `start_index` to `mid_index`, as a larger minimum distance might be possible.
        - Otherwise:
            - Updates `end_index` to `mid_index - 1`, as the minimum distance must be smaller.

4. **Result Calculation/Return:**
    - After the loop ends, `start_index` will have converged to the maximum possible minimum distance, which is
      returned.

#### Example {id="example_d4_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Input:** `position = [64, 16, 128, 8, 2, 32, 1, 4], m = 4`

**Step-by-Step Walkthrough:**

1. **Initialization:**
    - The `position` list is sorted: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128]`
    - `start_index` is set to 1 (minimum possible distance)
    - `end_index` is set to (128 - 1) // (4 - 1) = 42 (maximum possible average distance)

2. **Binary Search Loop:**

    - **While 1 < 42 (Iteration 1):**
        - `mid_index = 1 + (1 + 42) // 2 = 22`
        - `can_place_balls(22)` returns True
            - Balls are placed at positions 1, 32, 64, 128
        - `start_index` is updated to 22

    - **While 22 < 42 (Iteration 2):**
        - `mid_index = 1 + (22 + 42) // 2 = 33`
        - `can_place_balls(33)` returns False
            - Only 3 balls can be placed (at 1, 64, 128)
        - `end_index` is updated to 32

    - **Iteration 3:**
        - `mid_index = 1 + (22 + 32) // 2 = 28`
        - `can_place_balls(28)` returns True
            - Balls are placed at positions 1, 32, 64, 128
        - `start_index` is updated to 28

    - **Iteration 4:**
        - `mid_index = 1 + (28 + 32) // 2 = 31`
        - `can_place_balls(31)` returns True
            - Balls are placed at positions 1, 32, 64, 128
        - `start_index` is updated to 31

    - **Iteration 5:**
        - `mid_index = 1 + (31 + 32) // 2 = 32`
        - `can_place_balls(32)` returns False
            - Only 3 balls can be placed (at 1, 64, 128)
        - `end_index` is updated to 31

3. **Loop Termination:**
    - The loop terminates when `start_index` (31) is no longer less than `end_index` (31)

4. **Visual Aid: Iteration Summary Table**

   | Iteration | Start Index | End Index | Mid Index | Can Place |
                  |-----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
   | 1         | 1           | 42        | 22        | True      |
   | 2         | 22          | 42        | 33        | False     |
   | 3         | 22          | 32        | 28        | True      |
   | 4         | 28          | 32        | 31        | True      |
   | 5         | 31          | 32        | 32        | False     |

5. **Result Calculation/Final Steps:**
    - The algorithm returns `start_index`, which is 31
    - This means the maximum possible minimum distance between any two balls is 31

The final result indicates that we can place four balls in the baskets such that the minimum distance between any
two balls is 31, and this is the maximum possible minimum distance we can achieve.
We can place them at positions 1, 32, 64, and 128. The distance between each position is 31, 32, and 64, respectively;
hence, the minimum distance is 31.

#### Complexity Analysis {id="complexity-analysis_d4_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Time Complexity:**

- $O(n \log(n \cdot range))$, where $n$ is the number of positions and range is $(\max(\text{position}) - \min(
  \text{position})) / (m - 1)$.
- This comes from two main operations:
    1. Sorting the positions: $O(n \log n)$
    2. Binary search with ball placement check: $O(\log(range))$ iterations, each doing an $O(n)$ check.
- Combined, this gives $O(n \log n + n \log(range)) = O(n \log(n \cdot range))$

**Space Complexity:**

- $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of positions.
- This is due to the space required for sorting the `position` array, as Python's sort() method uses TimSort, which can
  require additional space in the worst case.
- The rest of the algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space.

## June 21 -> 1052. Grumpy Bookstore Owner {collapsible="true" default-state="collapsed"}

There is a bookstore owner that has a store open for `n` minutes.
Every minute, some number of customers enters the store.
You are given an integer array `customers` of length `n` where `customers[i]` is the number of the customer that enters
the store at the start of the `ith` minute and all those customers leave after the end of that minute.

In some minutes, the bookstore owner is grumpy.
You are given a binary array grumpy where `grumpy[i]` is `1` if the bookstore owner is grumpy during the `ith` minute,
and is `0` otherwise.

When the bookstore owner is grumpy, the customers of that minute are not satisfied, otherwise, they are satisfied.

The bookstore owner knows a secret technique to keep themselves not grumpy for `minutes` consecutive minutes,
but can only use it once.

Return *the maximum number of customers that can be satisfied throughout the day*.

**Example 1:**

- **Input:** customers = [1,0,1,2,1,1,7,5], grumpy = [0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1], minutes = 3
- **Output:** 16
- **Explanation:** The bookstore owner keeps themselves not grumpy for the last 3 minutes.
  The maximum number of customers that can be satisfied = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 7 + 5 = 16.

**Example 2:**

- **Input:** customers = [1], grumpy = [0], minutes = 1
- **Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

- `n == customers.length == grumpy.length`
- `1 <= minutes <= n <= 2 * 10^4`
- `0 <= customers[i] <= 1000`
- `grumpy[i]` is either `0` or `1`.

### Approach 1: Sliding Window {id="approach_d5_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

```Python
def maxSatisfied1(customers: List[int], grumpy: List[int],
                  minutes: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the maximum number of satisfied customers in a bookstore
    given a limited period where the owner can avoid being grumpy.

    The function first calculates the number of customers that are normally
    satisfied when the owner is not grumpy. It then uses a sliding window
    technique to find the period during which the owner can suppress their
    grumpiness to maximize the number of additionally satisfied customers.
    This is achieved by iterating through the customers and grumpy lists,
    keeping track of the maximum number of potentially satisfied customers
    over any given period of 'minutes' length. There is a slight optimization
    by combining the normal and additional satisfaction calculations into the
    same loop.

    The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where `n` is the length
    of the customers list, because it processes each element of the list a
    constant number of times. The space complexity is O(1), since it uses a
    fixed amount of additional space regardless of the input size.
    """
    satisfied_customers = 0
    potential_customers = 0

    # Calculate initial normal and potential satisfaction for the first
    # 'minutes' window
    for customer, grump in zip(customers[:minutes], grumpy[:minutes]):
        if grump:
            potential_customers += customer
        else:
            satisfied_customers += customer

    max_potential_customers = potential_customers

    # Sliding window to find the maximum additional satisfaction over any
    # 'minutes' period (plus normal satisfaction)

        else:
            satisfied_customers += customers[minute]

        # Remove unsatisfied customers that are outside the current window
        if grumpy[minute - minutes]:

        max_potential_customers = max(max_potential_customers,
                                      potential_customers)

#### Understanding the Core Idea {id="core-idea_d5_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

The central concept of this solution is to leverage a sliding window technique to maximize customer satisfaction given
the constraint of a limited period where the bookstore owner can suppress their grumpiness.
The solution exploits the pattern in the data by separating normally satisfied customers from potentially satisfied
customers during the owner's non-grumpy period.

- **Two-part Satisfaction Calculation:** The solution divides customer satisfaction into two parts: those naturally
  satisfied when the owner isn't grumpy, and additional customers that could be satisfied during the "non-grumpy"
  window.

- **Sliding Window for Optimization:** A sliding window of size `minutes` is used to find the optimal period for the
  owner to use their "non-grumpy" technique, maximizing additional customer satisfaction.

- **Single-pass Approach:** The solution cleverly combines the calculation of normally satisfied customers and the
  sliding window technique into a single pass through the data, optimizing for efficiency.

> **Key Insight:**
> By maintaining a running count of potential additional satisfied customers within the current window, the algorithm
> can efficiently update and track the maximum possible additional satisfaction as it moves through the data.

#### Code Walkthrough {id="code-walkthrough_d5_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

1. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   satisfied_customers = 0
   potential_customers = 0
   ```
   These variables track normally satisfied customers and potential additional satisfied customers in the current
   window.

2. **Initial Window Calculation:**
   ```python
   for customer, grump in zip(customers[:minutes], grumpy[:minutes]):
       if grump:
           potential_customers += customer
       else:
           satisfied_customers += customer
   ```
   This loop calculates initial satisfaction for the first `minutes` window, separating normally satisfied from
   potential additional customers.

3. **Maximum Potential Tracking:**
   ```python
   max_potential_customers = potential_customers
   ```
   Initializes the maximum potential additional satisfied customers with the first window's value.

4. **Sliding Window Implementation:**
   ```python
   for minute in range(minutes, len(customers)):
   ```
   This loop slides the window through the remaining data, one customer at a time.

5. **Window Update:**
   ```python
   if grumpy[minute]:
       potential_customers += customers[minute]
   else:
       satisfied_customers += customers[minute]
   ```
   Updates satisfaction counts for the new customer entering the window.

6. **Window Tail Removal:**
   ```python
   if grumpy[minute - minutes]:
       potential_customers -= customers[minute - minutes]
   ```
   Removes the contribution of the customer leaving the window if they were part of the potential satisfaction count.

7. **Maximum Update:**
   ```python
   max_potential_customers = max(max_potential_customers,
                                      potential_customers)
   ```
   Updates the maximum potential additional satisfied customers if the current window is better.

8. **Result Calculation/Return:**
   ```python
   return satisfied_customers + max_potential_customers
   ```
   Combines normally satisfied customers with the maximum additional satisfied customers from the optimal "non-grumpy"
   window.

#### Example {id="example_d5_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Input:**

```python
customers = [1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 7, 5]
grumpy = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
minutes = 3
```

**Step-by-Step Walkthrough:**

1. **Initialization:**
    - `satisfied_customers = 0`
    - `potential_customers = 0`

2. **Main Loop (Initial Window Calculation):**

   Since `minutes = 3`, the initial window covers the first three minutes:

    - **Iteration 1 (minute 0):**
        - `customer = 1`, `grump = 0`
        - Owner is not grumpy, so add to `satisfied_customers`
        - `satisfied_customers = 1`, `potential_customers = 0`

    - **Iteration 2 (minute 1):**
        - `customer = 0`, `grump = 1`
        - Owner is grumpy, but no customers to add to `potential_customers`
        - `satisfied_customers = 1`, `potential_customers = 0`

    - **Iteration 3 (minute 2):**
        - `customer = 1`, `grump = 0`
        - Owner is not grumpy, so add to `satisfied_customers`
        - `satisfied_customers = 2`, `potential_customers = 0`

    - **Initial Window Summary:**
      ```Python
      [1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 7, 5] Customers
      [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1] Grumpy
      [S  P  S]                Window
      S: Satisfied = 2, P: Potential = 0, Max Potential = 0
      ```

3. **Sliding Window Loop:**

    - **Iteration 4 (minute 3):**
        - `customer = 2`, `grump = 1`
        - Owner is grumpy, add customers to `potential_customers`
            - `potential_customers = 0 + 2 = 2`
        - Current window: [1, 3]
        - Update `max_potential_customers = 2`
           ```Python

    - **Iteration 5 (minute 4):**
        - `customer = 1`, `grump = 0`
        - Owner is not grumpy, add customer to `satisfied_customers`
            - `satisfied_customers = 2 + 1 = 3`
        - Current window: [2, 4]
        - No change to `potential_customers`
           ```Python
           [1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 7, 5] Customers
           [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1] Grumpy

           S: Satisfied = 3, P: Potential = 2, Max Potential = 2
           ```

    - **Iteration 6 (minute 5):**
        - `customer = 1`, `grump = 1`
        - Owner is grumpy, add customers to `potential_customers`
            - `potential_customers = 2 + 1 = 3`
        - Current window: [3, 5]
        - Update `max_potential_customers = 3`
           ```Python

           S: Satisfied = 3, P: Potential = 3, Max Potential = 3
           ```

    - **Iteration 7 (minute 6):**
        - `customer = 7`, `grump = 0`
        - Owner is not grumpy, add to `satisfied_customers`
        - `satisfied_customers = 10`
        - Current window: [4, 6]
            - Remove 2 from `potential_customers` (from minute 3)
            - `potential_customers = 3 - 2 = 1`
            - The maximum potential customers remain at 3
           ```Python
           [1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 7, 5] Customers
           [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1] Grumpy

5. **Result Calculation:**
    - Final `satisfied_customers = 10`
    - Final `max_potential_customers = 6`
    - Total satisfied customers = `satisfied_customers + max_potential_customers = 10 + 6 = 16`

The algorithm returns 16 as the maximum number of customers that can be satisfied throughout the day.

#### Complexity Analysis {id="complexity-analysis_d5_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Time Complexity:**

- $O(n$), where $n$ is the number of minutes (length of the customers list).
  This is because the algorithm makes a single pass through the data, performing constant-time operations at each step.

**Space Complexity:**

- $O(1)$, as the algorithm uses a fixed amount of additional space (a few variables) regardless of the input size.
  It doesn't create any data structures that scale with the input.

## June 22 -> 1248. Count Number of Nice Subarrays {collapsible="true" default-state="collapsed"}

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`.
A continuous subarray is called **nice** if there are `k` odd numbers on it.

Return *the number of **nice** subarrays*.

**Example 1:**

- **Input:** nums = [1,1,2,1,1], k = 3
- **Output:** 2
- **Explanation:** The only subarrays with three odd numbers are [1,1,2,1] and [1,2,1,1].

**Example 2:**

- **Input:** nums = [2,4,6], k = 1
- **Output:** 0
- **Explanation:** There are no odd numbers in the array.

**Example 3:**

- **Input:** nums = [2,2,2,1,2,2,1,2,2,2], k = 2
- **Output:** 16

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 50000`

The central concept of this solution is to use a sliding window technique combined with a counting approach to
efficiently find nice subarrays.
The solution exploits the fact that once a nice subarray is found, any extension of it that doesn't include new odd

- **Sliding Window:** The solution maintains a window that expands when odd numbers are encountered and contracts when
  the odd count exceeds `k`.
- **Incremental Counting:** Instead of recounting for each subarray, it incrementally updates the count of nice
  subarrays.

#### Code Walkthrough {id="code-walkthrough_d6_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

1. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   total_nice_subarrays = 0
   current_nice_subarrays = 0
   odd_count = 0
   start_index = 0
   ```
   The function initializes several variables:
    - `total_nice_subarrays` to store the final count of nice subarrays.
    - `current_nice_subarrays` to track the number of valid subarrays ending at the current position.
    - `odd_count` to count the number of odd numbers in the current window.
    - `start_index` to mark the beginning of the current window.

2. **Iterate Through Array:**
   ```python
   for num in nums:
   ```
   This loop processes each number in the input array.

3. **Handle Odd Numbers:**
   ```python
   if num % 2 == 1:
       odd_count += 1
       current_nice_subarrays = 0
   ```
   When an odd number is encountered, the odd count is incremented and the current nice subarray count is reset.

4. **Window Adjustment and Counting:**
   ```python
   while odd_count == k:
       current_nice_subarrays += 1
       odd_count -= nums[start_index] % 2
       start_index += 1
   ```
   When `k` odd numbers are found, this loop counts nice subarrays by moving the start of the window.
   It increments the count for each valid start position and stops when an odd number is removed from the window.

5. **Accumulate Nice Subarray Count:**
   ```python
   total_nice_subarrays += current_nice_subarrays
   ```
   The count of nice subarrays ending at the current position is added to the total.

6. **Return Result:**
   ```python
   return total_nice_subarrays
   ```
   The function returns the total count of nice subarrays found.

#### Example {id="example_d6_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Input:**

```python
nums = [2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2]
k = 2
```

**Step-by-Step Walkthrough:**

1. **Initialization:**
    - `total_nice_subarrays = 0`: Keeps track of all nice subarrays found
    - `current_nice_subarrays = 0`: Counts nice subarrays ending at the current position
    - `odd_count = 0`: Tracks the number of odd integers in the current window
    - `start_index = 0`: Marks the start of the current window

2. **Main Loop (Iterating through nums):**

   - **Iteration 1 (num = 2):**
       - 2 is even, so no changes to `odd_count` or `current_nice_subarrays`
       - No nice subarrays found yet

   - **Iteration 2 (num = 1):**
       - 1 is odd, so `odd_count` increases to 1
       - `current_nice_subarrays` resets to 0 (new odd number encountered)
       - Still no nice subarrays (need two odd numbers)

   - **Iteration 3 (num = 2):**
       - 2 is even, no changes to counters
       - No nice subarrays yet

   - **Iteration 4 (num = 1):**
       - 1 is odd, `odd_count` increases to 2
       - `current_nice_subarrays` resets to 0
       - `odd_count == k`, so we enter the while loop:

           1. `current_nice_subarrays` increases to 1
           2. Check if nums[0] (2) is odd - it's not, so `odd_count` remains 2
           3. `start_index` increases to 1
           4. Still `odd_count == k`, so loop continues
           5. `current_nice_subarrays` increases to 2
           6. nums[1] (1) is odd, so `odd_count` decreases to 1
           7. `start_index` increases to 2
       - `total_nice_subarrays` becomes 2

   - **Iteration 5 (num = 2):**
       - 2 is even, no changes to `odd_count`
       - `total_nice_subarrays` increases to 4 (2 + 2)

   - **Iteration 6 (num = 1):**
       - 1 is odd, `odd_count` increases to 2
       - `current_nice_subarrays` resets to 0
       - `odd_count == k`, enter while loop:
           1. `current_nice_subarrays` increases to 1
           2. nums[2] (2) is not odd, `odd_count` stays 2
           3. `start_index` increases to 3
           4. Still `odd_count == k`, continue loop
           5. `current_nice_subarrays` increases to 2
           6. nums[3] (1) is odd, `odd_count` decreases to 1
           7. `start_index` increases to 4
       - `total_nice_subarrays` becomes 6 (4 + 2)

   - **Iteration 7 (num = 2):**
       - 2 is even, no changes to `odd_count`
       - `total_nice_subarrays` increases to 8 (6 + 2)

   - **Iteration 8 (num = 2):**
       - 2 is even, no changes to `odd_count`
       - `total_nice_subarrays` increases to 10 (8 + 2)

3. **Loop Termination:**
    - The loop ends after processing all elements in `nums`
    - Final state: `total_nice_subarrays = 10`, `odd_count = 1`, `start_index = 4`

4. **Result Calculation:**
    - The final result is the value of `total_nice_subarrays`, which is 10
    - This represents the total number of subarrays containing exactly `k = 2` odd numbers

#### Complexity Analysis {id="complexity-analysis_d6_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Time Complexity:**

- $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input array nums.
  This is because each element in the array is processed at most twice:
  once in the outer for loop and potentially once in the inner while loop.

**Space Complexity:**

- $O(1)$, as the algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
  It maintains a few variables (`total_nice_subarrays`, `current_nice_subarrays`, `odd_count`, `start_index`)
  that do not grow with the input size.

#### Understanding the Core Idea {id="core-idea_d6_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

The central concept of this solution is to leverage a two-pass approach to efficiently count nice subarrays.
It exploits the structure of the array by focusing on the distribution of odd numbers and the even numbers between them.

- **Even Number Counting:** The solution counts the number of even integers between each pair of odd integers, including
  the ends of the array.
- **Combinatorial Calculation:** It uses these counts to calculate the total number of nice subarrays without explicitly
  listing them.

> **Key Insight:**
> For each sequence of `k` odd numbers, the number of nice subarrays is the product of the number of even numbers
> before the first odd number and after the last odd number in the sequence.
> This allows for efficient counting without needing to consider each subarray individually.

#### Code Walkthrough {id="code-walkthrough_d6_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

1. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   even_counts = []
   current_even_count, odd_count = 1, 0
   ```
   `even_counts` will store the count of even numbers between odd numbers, and
   `current_even_count` is initialized to 1 to account for the start of the array.

2. **Count Even Numbers and Identify Odd Numbers:**
   ```python
   for num in nums:
       if num % 2 == 0:
           current_even_count += 1
       else:
           even_counts.append(current_even_count)
           current_even_count = 1
   even_counts.append(current_even_count)
   ```
   This loop counts even numbers between odd numbers.
   When an odd number is encountered, the current count of even numbers is appended to `even_counts`,
   and the count is reset.
   The final `even_counts.append(current_even_count)` accounts for even numbers at the end of the array.

3. **Calculate Nice Subarrays:**
   ```python
   total_nice_subarrays = 0
   for left_even_count, right_even_count in zip(even_counts, even_counts[k:]):
       total_nice_subarrays += left_even_count * right_even_count
   ```
   This loop calculates the number of nice subarrays.
   It pairs the count of even numbers before a sequence of `k` odd numbers with the count after,
   multiplying them to get the number of nice subarrays for that sequence.

4. **Return Result:**
   ```python
   return total_nice_subarrays
   ```
   The function returns the total count of nice subarrays found.

**Input:**
```python
nums = [2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2]

```

**Step-by-Step Walkthrough:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - `even_counts = []`: List to store counts of consecutive even numbers
   - `current_even_count = 1`: Initialize count of the current sequence of even numbers

2. **First Pass: Counting Even Numbers**

   - **Iteration 1 (num = 2):**
      - 2 is even, so `current_even_count` increases to 2
      - `even_counts` remains empty: []

   - **Iteration 5 (num = 2):**
      - 2 is even, so `current_even_count` increases to 2

      - 1 is odd, so we append `current_even_count` (2) to `even_counts`
      - Reset `current_even_count` to 1
      - `even_counts` becomes [2, 2, 2]

   - **Iteration 7 (num = 2):**

      - 2 is even, so `current_even_count` increases to 3
      - `even_counts` remains [2, 2, 2]

3. **Loop Termination:**
   - After processing all numbers, append final `current_even_count` (3) to `even_counts`
   - Final state of `even_counts`: [2, 2, 2, 3]

4. **Second Pass: Calculating Nice Subarrays**

   - **Iteration 1:**
      - `left_even_count = 2` (from `even_counts[0]`)
      - `right_even_count = 2` (from `even_counts[2]`)
      - Calculate nice subarrays: 2 * 2 = 4
      - `total_nice_subarrays` becomes 4

   - **Iteration 2:**
      - `left_even_count = 2` (from `even_counts[1]`)
      - `right_even_count = 3` (from `even_counts[3]`)
      - Calculate nice subarrays: 2 * 3 = 6
      - `total_nice_subarrays` increases to 10 (4 + 6)

5. **Visual Aid:**

   Iteration Summary Table:
   
   | Subarray | Left Even Count | Right Even Count | Nice Subarrays | Total Nice Subarrays |
   |----------|-----------------|------------------|----------------|----------------------|
   | 1        | 2               | 2                | 4              | 4                    |

6. **Result Calculation/Final Steps:**
   - The final result is the value of `total_nice_subarrays`, which is 10
   - This represents the total number of subarrays containing exactly two odd numbers

## June 23 -> 1438. Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff Less Than or Equal to Limit {collapsible="true" default-state="collapsed"}

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `limit`, return the size of the longest **non-empty** subarray such
that the absolute difference between any two elements of this subarray is less than or equal to `limit`.

**Example 1:**

- **Input:** nums = [8,2,4,7], limit = 4
- **Output:** 2
- **Explanation:** All subarrays are:
   - [8] with maximum absolute diff |8-8| = 0 <= 4.
   - [8,2] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
   - [8,2,4] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
   - [8,2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
   - [2] with maximum absolute diff |2-2| = 0 <= 4.
   - [2,4] with maximum absolute diff |2-4| = 2 <= 4.
   - [2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |2-7| = 5 > 4.
   - [4] with maximum absolute diff |4-4| = 0 <= 4.
   - [4,7] with maximum absolute diff |4-7| = 3 <= 4.
   - [7] with maximum absolute diff |7-7| = 0 <= 4.
   - Therefore, the size of the longest subarray is 2.

**Example 2:**

- **Input:** nums = [10,1,2,4,7,2], limit = 5
- **Output:** 4
- **Explanation:** The subarray [2,4,7,2] is the longest since the maximum absolute diff is |2-7| = 5 <= 5.

**Example 3:**

- **Input:** nums = [4,2,2,2,4,4,2,2], limit = 0
- **Output:** 3

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `0 <= limit <= 10^9`

### Approach 1: Sliding Window with Sorted List {id="approach_d7_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

```Python
def longestSubarray1(nums: List[int], limit: int) -> int:
    """
    Finds the length of the longest subarray where the absolute difference
    between any two elements is at most 'limit'.

    This function uses a sliding window approach combined with a sorted list
    to track the elements in the current window. It iterates through the
    array once, maintaining a sorted representation of the current window.
    When a new element is added, it's inserted into its correct position in
    the sorted list. If the difference between the maximum and minimum
    elements (which are always at the ends of the sorted list) exceeds the
    limit, the window is shrunk from the left by removing the leftmost
    element from the sorted list.

    The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) in the worst case, where
    `n` is the length of the input array. This  is because for each element
    (O(n)), we might need to perform an insertion into a sorted list (O(n)
    using bisect.insort). However, in practice, it can be much faster if
    the subarrays tend to be short. The space complexity is O(n), as in the
    worst case, the sorted list might contain all elements of the input array.

#### Understanding the Core Idea {id="core-idea_d7_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

The central concept of this solution is to leverage a sliding window approach combined with a sorted list to efficiently
find the longest subarray that satisfies the given condition.
This technique allows us to maintain a dynamic view of the current subarray while keeping track of its minimum and
maximum elements.

- **Sliding Window:** The solution uses two pointers (`left_index` and the current iteration index) to define a window
  that expands and contracts as we iterate through the array.
- **Sorted List:** A sorted list is maintained to represent the elements in the current window, allowing for quick
  access to the minimum and maximum elements.
- **Dynamic Window Adjustment:** As new elements are added, the window expands.
  If the condition is violated, the window contracts from the left side.

> **Key Insight:**
> By keeping the window elements sorted, we can always access the minimum and maximum elements in
> constant time, allowing for efficient checking of the limit condition.

#### Code Walkthrough {id="code-walkthrough_d7_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

1. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   left_index = 0
   sorted_nums = []
   ```
   The `left_index` variable keeps track of the left boundary of our sliding window.
   `sorted_nums` is an empty list that will store the elements of the current window in sorted order.

2. **Iterating Through the Array:**
   ```python
   for num in nums:
   ```
   This loop processes each element of the input array `nums` sequentially.

3. **Inserting New Element:**
   ```python
   bisect.insort(sorted_nums, num)
   ```
   The current element `num` is inserted into `sorted_nums` at its correct position, maintaining the sorted
   order.
   `bisect.insort` is used for efficient insertion in a sorted list.

4. **Checking and Adjusting Window:**
   ```python
   if sorted_nums[-1] - sorted_nums[0] > limit:
       sorted_nums.pop(bisect.bisect(sorted_nums, nums[left_index]) - 1)
       left_index += 1
   ```
   This block checks if the difference between the maximum (last element) and minimum (first element) of the sorted list
   exceeds the limit.
   If so, it removes the leftmost element of the window from `sorted_nums` and moves the left boundary of the window.

5. **Result Calculation/Return:**
   ```python
   return len(nums) - left_index
   ```
   The function returns the length of the longest valid subarray, which is the total length of the array minus the left
   index of the sliding window.

      - Insert 1 into `sorted_nums`: [1, 10]
      - Condition is true: 10 - 1 = 9 > 5
      - Remove 10 (leftmost element) and update `left_index` to 1
      - Current subarray length: 1

   - **Iteration 3 (num = 2):**
      - Insert 2 into `sorted_nums`: [1, 2]
      - Condition is false: 2 - 1 = 1 ≤ 5

3. **Loop Termination:**

5. **Result Calculation:**
   - The final result is calculated as: `len(nums) - left_index`
   - `len(nums)` = 6, `left_index` = 2
   - Result = 6 - 2 = 4

The longest subarray where the absolute difference between any two elements is at most 5 has a length of 4, which
corresponds to the subarray [2, 4, 7, 2].

#### Understanding the Core Idea {id="core-idea_d7_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

The central concept of this solution is to leverage a sliding window approach combined with two heaps (min-heap and
max-heap) to efficiently find the longest subarray that satisfies the given condition.
This technique allows us to maintain a dynamic view of the current subarray while keeping track of its minimum and
maximum elements in a more efficient manner.

- **Sliding Window:** The solution uses two pointers (`left_index` and `right_index`) to define a window that expands and
  contracts as we iterate through the array.
- **Dual Heap Structure:** Two heaps (min-heap and max-heap) are used to efficiently track the minimum and maximum
  elements in the current window.
- **Dynamic Window Adjustment:** As new elements are added, the window expands.
  If the condition is violated, the window contracts from the left side until the condition is satisfied again.

> **Key Insight:**
> By using heaps, we can retrieve and update the minimum and maximum elements in logarithmic time,
> which is more efficient than maintaining a fully sorted list, especially for larger windows.

#### Code Walkthrough {id="code-walkthrough_d7_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

1. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   max_heap = []
   min_heap = []
   left_index = 0
   max_length = 0
   ```
   Two empty heaps are initialized: `max_heap` for maximum elements and `min_heap` for minimum elements.
   `left_index` tracks the left boundary of the sliding window,
   and `max_length` stores the length of the longest valid subarray found so far.

2. **Iterating Through the Array:**
   ```python
   for right_index, num in enumerate(nums):
   ```
   This loop processes each element of the input array `nums` sequentially, using `right_index` as the current position.

3. **Adding Elements to Heaps:**
   ```python
   heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-num, right_index))
   heapq.heappush(min_heap, (num, right_index))
   ```
   The current element `num` is added to both heaps.
   Note that for `max_heap`, we use the negative of `num` to create a max-heap using Python's min-heap implementation.

4. **Adjusting Window:**
   ```python
   while -max_heap[0][0] - min_heap[0][0] > limit:
       left_index = min(max_heap[0][1], min_heap[0][1]) + 1
       while max_heap[0][1] < left_index:
           heapq.heappop(max_heap)
       while min_heap[0][1] < left_index:
           heapq.heappop(min_heap)
   ```
   This block checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum elements exceeds the limit.
   If so, it moves the left boundary of the window and removes elements from the heaps that are now outside the window.

5. **Updating Maximum Length:**
   ```python
   max_length = max(max_length, right_index - left_index + 1)
   ```
   After each iteration, update the `max_length` if the current window is longer than the previous maximum.

6. **Result Calculation/Return:**
   ```python
   return max_length
   ```
   The function returns the length of the longest valid subarray.

#### Example {id="example_d7_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Input:**

```python
nums = [10, 1, 2, 4, 7, 2]
limit = 5
```

**Step-by-Step Walkthrough:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize empty `max_heap` and `min_heap`
   - Set `left_index = 0` and `max_length = 0`

2. **Main Loop (Iterate through nums):**

   - **Iteration 1 (nums[0] = 10):**
      - Push (10, 0) to `max_heap` as (-10, 0) and to `min_heap` as (10, 0)
        - The heaps become:
          - `max_heap = [(-10, 0)]`
          - `min_heap = [(10, 0)]`
      - No window adjustment needed (10 - 10 = 0 <= 5)

   - **Iteration 2 (nums[1] = 1):**
      - Push (1, 1) to both heaps
        - The heaps become:
          - `max_heap = [(-10, 0), (-1, 1)]`
          - `min_heap = [(1, 1), (10, 0)]`
      - Window adjustment: 10 - 1 = 9 > 5
         - Update `left_index` to 1
         - Remove (-10, 0) from `max_heap`: `max_heap = [(-1, 1)]`

      - Push (2, 2) to both heaps
        - The heaps become:
          - `max_heap = [(-1, 1), (-2, 2)]`
          - `min_heap = [(1, 1), (2, 2), (10, 0)]`
      - No window adjustment needed (2 - 1 = 1 <= 5)
      - Update `max_length` to 2

   - **Iteration 4 (nums[3] = 4):**
      - Push (4, 3) to both heaps
        - The heaps become:
          - `max_heap = [(-1, 1), (-2, 2), (-4, 3)]`
          - `min_heap = [(1, 1), (2, 2), (4, 3), (10, 0)]`
      - No window adjustment needed (4 - 1 = 3 <= 5)
      - Update `max_length` to 3

   - **Iteration 5 (nums[4] = 7):**
      - Push (7, 4) to both heaps
        - The heaps become:
          - `max_heap = [(-1, 1), (-2, 2), (-4, 3), (-7, 4)]`
          - `min_heap = [(1, 1), (2, 2), (4, 3), (7, 4), (10, 0)]`
      - Window adjustment: 7 - 1 = 6 > 5
         - Update `left_index` to 2
         - Remove (1, 1) from `min_heap`: `min_heap = [(2, 2), (4, 3), (7, 4), (10, 0)]`
      - `max_length` remains 3

   - **Iteration 6 (nums[5] = 2):**
      - Push (2, 5) to both heaps
        - The heaps become:
          - `max_heap = [(-2, 2), (-4, 3), (-7, 4), (-2, 5)]`
          - `min_heap = [(2, 2), (4, 3), (7, 4), (10, 0)]`
      - No window adjustment needed (7 - 2 = 5 <= 5)
      - Update `max_length` to 4

3. **Loop Termination:**
   - The loop ends after processing all elements in `nums`
   - Final state: `left_index = 2`, `max_length = 4`

4. **Visual Aid: Iteration Summary Table**

   | Iteration | Current Number | Left Index | Current Length | Max Length | Max Heap (top 3)         | Min Heap (top 3)          |
   |-----------|----------------|------------|----------------|------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
   | 1         | 10             | 0          | 1              | 1          | [(10, 0)]                | [(10, 0)]                 |
   | 2         | 1              | 1          | 1              | 1          | [(1, 1)]                 | [(1, 1), (10, 0)]         |
   | 3         | 2              | 1          | 2              | 2          | [(2, 2), (1, 1)]         | [(1, 1), (10, 0), (2, 2)] |
   | 4         | 4              | 1          | 3              | 3          | [(4, 3), (1, 1), (2, 2)] | [(1, 1), (4, 3), (2, 2)]  |
   | 5         | 7              | 2          | 3              | 3          | [(7, 4), (4, 3), (2, 2)] | [(2, 2), (4, 3), (7, 4)]  |
   | 6         | 2              | 2          | 4              | 4          | [(7, 4), (4, 3), (2, 2)] | [(2, 2), (2, 5), (7, 4)]  |

5. **Result Calculation/Final Steps:**
   - The algorithm maintains the max_length variable throughout the iterations
   - After processing all elements, `max_length` holds the length of the longest valid subarray
   - The final result is `max_length = 4`, corresponding to the subarray [2, 4, 7, 2]

#### Complexity Analysis {id="complexity-analysis_d7_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Time Complexity:**

- $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input array `nums`.
  This is because for each element in the array $(O(n))$, we perform heap operations (push and pop) which take
  $O(\log n)$ time.
  In the worst case, we might need to perform these operations for each element.

**Space Complexity:**

- $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input array `nums`.
  This is because in the worst case, all elements might be stored in the heaps simultaneously.

### Approach 3: Sliding Window with Monotonic Queues {id="approach_d7_3" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

```Python
def longestSubarray3(nums: List[int], limit: int) -> int:
    """
    Finds the length of the longest subarray where the absolute difference
    between any two elements is at most 'limit'.

    This function uses a sliding window approach with two monotonic queues
    (deques) to efficiently track the maximum and minimum elements in the
    current window. As we iterate through the array, we maintain a
    monotonically decreasing queue for maximum values and a monotonically
    increasing queue for minimum values. This allows us to quickly access
    the maximum and minimum elements of the current window at any time.
    When the difference between these extremes exceeds the limit, we
    shrink the window from the left, updating the queues accordingly.

    The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of
    the input array. This is because each element is pushed and popped at
    most once from each deque, and all operations on deques are O(1). The
    space complexity is O(n) in the worst case, as the deques might need to
    store all elements of the input array.
    """
    max_queue = deque()
    min_queue = deque()
    left_index = 0
    for right_index, num in enumerate(nums):
        # Maintain monotonically decreasing queue for maximum values
        while max_queue and num > max_queue[-1]:
            max_queue.pop()
        max_queue.append(num)

        # Maintain monotonically increasing queue for minimum values
        while min_queue and num < min_queue[-1]:
            min_queue.pop()
        min_queue.append(num)

        # Shrink the window if the difference exceeds the limit
        if max_queue[0] - min_queue[0] > limit:
            if max_queue[0] == nums[left_index]:
                max_queue.popleft()
            if min_queue[0] == nums[left_index]:
                min_queue.popleft()
            left_index += 1

    return len(nums) - left_index
```

#### Code Walkthrough {id="code-walkthrough_d7_3" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

1. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   max_queue = deque()
   min_queue = deque()
   left_index = 0
   ```
   Two empty deques are initialized: `max_queue` for maximum elements and `min_queue` for minimum elements.
   `left_index` tracks the left boundary of the sliding window.

2. **Iterating Through the Array:**
   ```python
   for right_index, num in enumerate(nums):
   ```
   This loop processes each element of the input array `nums` sequentially, using `right_index` as the current position.

3. **Maintaining Monotonic Queues:**
   ```python
   while max_queue and num > max_queue[-1]:
       max_queue.pop()
   max_queue.append(num)

   while min_queue and num < min_queue[-1]:
       min_queue.pop()
   min_queue.append(num)
   ```
   These blocks maintain the monotonic property of the queues.
   For `max_queue`, we remove elements smaller than the current number from the right side before adding the
   current number.
   For `min_queue`, we remove elements larger than the current number.

4. **Adjusting Window:**
   ```python
   if max_queue[0] - min_queue[0] > limit:
       if max_queue[0] == nums[left_index]:
           max_queue.popleft()
       if min_queue[0] == nums[left_index]:
           min_queue.popleft()
       left_index += 1
   ```
   This block checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum elements exceeds the limit.
   If so, it moves the left boundary of the window and updates the queues if necessary.

5. **Result Calculation/Return:**
   ```python
   return len(nums) - left_index
   ```
   The function returns the length of the longest valid subarray, which is the total length of the array minus the final
   position of the left index.

**Time Complexity:**

- $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input array `nums`.
  This is because each element is processed once and all operations on the deques (`append`, `pop`, `pop-left`) are
  $O(1)$.
  Although there are nested loops, each element is pushed and popped at most once from each deque,
  ensuring linear time complexity.

**Space Complexity:**

- $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input array `nums`.
  This is because in the worst case, the deques might need to store all elements of the input array simultaneously.
