## Week 1 -> 1101. The Earliest Moment When Everyone Becomes Friends {collapsible="true" default-state="collapsed"}

There are n people in a social group labeled from `0` to `n - 1`.
You are given an array `logs`where `logs[i] = [timestamp_i, x_i, y_i]`
indicates that `x_i` and `y_i` will be friends at the time `timestamp_i`.

Friendship is **symmetric**. That means if `a` is friends with `b`, then `b` is friends with `a`. Also, person `a` is
acquainted with a person `b` if `a` is friends with `b`, or `a` is a friend of someone acquainted with `b`.

Return *the earliest time for which every person became acquainted with every other person*.
If there is no such earliest time, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

- **Input:**
  logs = [[20190101,0,1],[20190104,3,4],[20190107,2,3],[20190211,1,5],[20190224,2,4],[20190301,0,3],[20190312,1,2],[20190322,4,5]],
  n = 6
- **Output:** 20,190,301
- **Explanation:**
    - The first event occurs at timestamp = 20,190,101, and after 0 and 1 become friends, we have the following
      friendship groups [0,1], [2], [3], [4], [5].
    - The second event occurs at timestamp = 20,190,104, and after 3 and 4 become friends, we have the following
      friendship groups [0,1], [2], [3,4], [5].
    - The third event occurs at timestamp = 20,190,107, and after 2 and 3 become friends, we have the following
      friendship groups [0,1], [2,3,4], [5].
    - The fourth event occurs at timestamp = 20,190,211, and after 1 and 5 become friends, we have the following
      friendship groups [0,1,5], [2,3,4].
    - The fifth event occurs at timestamp = 20,190,224, and as 2 and 4 are already friends, nothing happens.
    - The sixth event occurs at timestamp = 20,190,301, and after 0 and 3 become friends, we all become friends.

**Example 2:**

- **Input:** logs = [[0,2,0],[1,0,1],[3,0,3],[4,1,2],[7,3,1]], n = 4
- **Output:** 3
- **Explanation:** At timestamp = 3, all the persons (i.e., 0, 1, 2, and 3) become friends.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= logs.length <= 10^4`
- `logs[i].length == 3`
- `0 <= timestamp_i <= 10^9`
- `0 <= x_i, y_i <= n - 1`
- `x_i != y_i`
- All the values `timestamp_i` are **unique**.
- All the pairs `(x_i, y_i)` occur at most one time in the input.

```Python
def earliestAcq1(logs: List[List[int]], n: int) -> int:
    """
    Determines the earliest time when all people in a social group become
    acquainted.

    This function uses the Union-Find data structure to efficiently track
    friend connections and group formations. It sorts the logs by timestamp
    and processes each friendship event chronologically. The algorithm
    leverages the properties of the Union-Find structure to quickly check if
    all individuals have become part of a single connected component.

    The time complexity of this solution is O(m log m + n + m * α(n)), where
    'm' is the number of logs, 'n' is the number of people and α(n) is the
    inverse Ackermann function. This is due to the initial sort operation
    (O(m log m)), the UnionFind initialization (O(n)) and for each log (m),
    we call the union operation which uses union by rank and calls find twice.
    Its time complexity is amortized O(α(n)). The space complexity is O(m + n),
    accounting for the sorted logs and the UnionFind data structure.
    """
    if len(logs) < n - 1:
        return -1  # Not enough friendships to connect all people

    logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])  # Sort logs by timestamp
    friend_network_uf = UnionFind(n)

    for timestamp, person_a, person_b in logs:
        friend_network_uf.union(person_a, person_b)
        if friend_network_uf.is_single_component():
            return timestamp  # All people are connected

    return -1

#### Understanding the Core Idea {id="core-idea_w1_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

The central concept of this solution is to leverage the Union-Find data structure to efficiently track friend
connections and group formations in a dynamic social network.
This approach allows us to quickly determine when all individuals become part of a single connected component.

- **Chronological Processing:** By sorting the logs by timestamp, we ensure that friendships are processed in the order
  they occur, allowing us to pinpoint the exact moment when full connectivity is achieved.

- **Union-Find Efficiency:** The Union-Find data structure provides near-constant time operations for joining sets (
  making friendships) and checking if all elements are in a single set (full connectivity).

- **Early Termination:** The algorithm can stop as soon as full connectivity is detected, avoiding unnecessary
  processing of later friendship logs.

> **Key Insight:** The use of Union-Find allows us to maintain a balance between efficient updates (forming friendships)
> and queries (checking for full connectivity), which is crucial for solving this problem efficiently.

#### Code Walkthrough {id="code-walkthrough_w1_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

1. **Initial Validation:**
   ```python
   if len(logs) < n - 1:
       return -1  # Not enough friendships to connect all people
   ```
   This check ensures that there are at least enough friendship logs to potentially connect all people.
   If not, we can immediately return -1 as it's impossible to achieve full connectivity.
   This is a graph theory concept where a connected graph with `n` nodes must have at least `n - 1` edges.

2. **Sorting Logs:**
   ```python
   logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])  # Sort logs by timestamp
   ```
   Sorting the logs by timestamp is crucial as it allows us to process friendships in chronological order.
   This is necessary to find the earliest time of full connectivity.
   We only need to consider the order of friendships, not the specific people involved; hence, we sort by `x[0]`.

3. **Initializing Union-Find:**
   ```python
   friend_network_uf = UnionFind(n)
   ```
   We initialize a Union-Find data structure with `n` elements, representing each person in the social network.
   This structure will efficiently track friend groups as they form and merge.

4. **Processing Friendships:**
   ```python
   for timestamp, person_a, person_b in logs:
       friend_network_uf.union(person_a, person_b)
       if friend_network_uf.is_single_component():
           return timestamp  # All people are connected
   ```
   We iterate through the sorted logs, performing two key operations for each friendship:
    - `union(person_a, person_b)`: This merges the sets containing `person_a` and `person_b`, effectively forming or
      expanding a friend group.
    - `is_single_component()`: After each union, we check if all people are now in a single component.
      If so, we've found the earliest time of full connectivity and can return the current timestamp.

5. **Final Check:**
   ```python
   return -1
   ```
   If we've processed all logs without achieving full connectivity, we return -1 to indicate that it's not possible with
   the given friendships.

#### Complexity Analysis {id="complexity-analysis_w1_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Time Complexity:**

- $O(m \log m + n + m \cdot \alpha(n))$, where $m$ is the number of logs, $n$ is the number of people, and $\alpha(n)$
  is the inverse Ackermann function.
    - Sorting the logs takes $O(m \log m)$ time.
    - Initializing the Union-Find structure takes $O(n)$ time.
    - Processing each log involves a union operation, which has an amortized time complexity of $O(\alpha(n))$ due to
      path compression and union by rank optimizations.
    - The $\alpha(n)$ factor grows extremely slowly and is effectively constant for all practical values of $n$, so the
      overall complexity is often simplified to $O(m \log m)$.

**Space Complexity:**

- $O(m + n)$, where $m$ is the number of logs and $n$ is the number of people.
    - The sorted logs array requires $O(m)$ space.
    - The Union-Find data structure uses $O(n)$ space to store the parent array and rank information for each person.
