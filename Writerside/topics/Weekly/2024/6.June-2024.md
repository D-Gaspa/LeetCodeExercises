## Week 1 -> 1940. Longest Common Subsequence Between Sorted Arrays {collapsible="true" default-state="collapsed"}

Given an array of integer arrays `arrays` where each `arrays[i]` is sorted in **strictly increasing** order, return *an integer array representing the **longest common subsequence** between **all** the arrays*.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Example 1:**

- **Input:** arrays = [[1,3,4], [1,4,7,9]]
- **Output:** [1,4]
- **Explanation:** The longest common subsequence in the two arrays is [1,4].

**Example 2:**

- **Input:** arrays = [[2,3,6,8], [1,2,3,5,6,7,10], [2,3,4,6,9]]
- **Output:** [2,3,6]
- **Explanation:** The longest common subsequence in all three arrays is [2,3,6].

**Example 3:**

- **Input:** arrays = [[1,2,3,4,5], [6,7,8]]
- **Output:** []
- **Explanation:** There is no common subsequence between the two arrays.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= arrays.length <= 100`
- `1 <= arrays[i].length <= 100`
- `1 <= arrays[i][j] <= 100`
- `arrays[i]` is sorted in **strictly increasing** order.

#### Understanding the Core Idea {id="core-idea_w1_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

The core idea of this solution is to optimize the search for common elements in multiple sorted arrays by focusing on the smallest array. It leverages binary search to efficiently check if elements from the smallest array exist in all other arrays. This approach reduces the overall search space and time complexity compared to a naive brute-force method.

- **Binary Search:** Utilizes the fact that the arrays are sorted to perform efficient logarithmic-time searches for elements.
- **Smallest Array Focus:** By iterating through the smallest array, we minimize the number of elements that need to be checked across all arrays, leading to a potential performance improvement.
- **Common Subsequence Construction:** An element is added to the longest common subsequence (LCS) only if it's found in all other arrays, ensuring the result is a valid subsequence shared by all.

#### Code Walkthrough {id="code-walkthrough_w1_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

1.  **Initialization:**
    - Finds the `smallest_array` using the `min` function with a key based on array length.
    - Removes the `smallest_array` from the `arrays` list to avoid redundant searches.
    - Initializes an empty list `common_subsequences` to store the LCS.

2.  **Helper Function (`binary_search`):**
    - This function takes an array `array` and a target number `num`.
    - It uses `bisect_left` to find the insertion point for `num` in `array` while maintaining sorted order.
    - If `num` is found at the insertion point, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

3.  **Main Loop (Finding Common Elements):**
    - Iterates through each `num` in the `smallest_array`.
    - For each `num`:
        - A generator expression checks if `num` is present in all remaining arrays using `binary_search`.
        - The `all` function checks if all results from the generator are `True`.
        - If `num` is found in all arrays, it's added to `common_subsequences`.

4.  **Return Result:**
    - Returns the `common_subsequences` list, representing the longest common subsequence found.

#### Example {id="example_w1_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Input:** `arrays = [[2, 3, 6, 8], [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10], [2, 3, 4, 6, 9]]`

**Step-by-Step Walkthrough:**

1. **Initialization:**
    - The function prints the initial `arrays` input: `[[2, 3, 6, 8], [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10], [2, 3, 4, 6, 9]]`
    - An empty list `common_subsequences` is initialized to store the LCS.

2. **Identifying Smallest Array:**
    - The function identifies `[2, 3, 6, 8]` as the smallest array.
    - This array is removed from the `arrays` list, leaving `[[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10], [2, 3, 4, 6, 9]]`.

3. **Main Loop (Finding Common Elements):** The function iterates through the smallest array, `[2, 3, 6, 8]`.

    - **Iteration 1:**
        - `num` = 2
        - `binary_search` is used to check for the presence of `2` in the remaining arrays:
            - `binary_search([1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10], 2)` returns `True`.
            - `binary_search([2, 3, 4, 6, 9], 2)` returns `True`.
        - Since `2` is found in both remaining arrays, it is added to `common_subsequences`: `[2]`

    - **Iteration 2:**
        - `num` = 3
        - `binary_search([1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10], 3)` returns `True`.
        - `binary_search([2, 3, 4, 6, 9], 3)` returns `True`.
        - '3' is added to `common_subsequences`: `[2, 3]`

    - **Iteration 3:**
        - `num` = 6
        - `binary_search([1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10], 6)` returns `True`.
        - `binary_search([2, 3, 4, 6, 9], 6)` returns `True`.
        - '6' is added to `common_subsequences`: `[2, 3, 6]`

    - **Iteration 4:**
        - `num` = 8
        - `binary_search([1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10], 8)` returns `False`.
        - Since '8' is not found in all arrays, the loop moves to the next iteration without updating `common_subsequences`.

4. **Iteration Summary:**
    
    | Iteration | `num` | `common_subsequences` |
    |-----------|-------|-----------------------|
    | 1         | 2     | [2]                   |
    | 2         | 3     | [2, 3]                |
    | 3         | 6     | [2, 3, 6]             |
    | 4         | 8     | [2, 3, 6]             |

5. **Result Calculation/Final Steps:**
    - The function reaches the end of the loop, and the final `common_subsequences` is `[2, 3, 6]`. This is returned as the longest common subsequence among the input arrays.

---

#### Complexity Analysis {id="complexity-analysis_w1_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Time Complexity:**

- $O(n \cdot m \cdot \log(k))$, where:
    - $n$ is the number of elements in the smallest array.
    - $m$ is the total number of arrays.
    - $k$ is the average length of the arrays.

- The nested loops dominate the time complexity. The outer loop iterates through the smallest array (n iterations), and the inner loop implicitly iterates through all remaining arrays (m-1 iterations) within the generator expression. For each element in the smallest array, we perform a binary search in each of the other arrays, with an average time complexity of O(log(k)).

**Space Complexity:**

- $O(L)$, where $L$ is the length of the longest common subsequence.
- The main space usage is due to storing the elements of the LCS in the `common_subsequences` list. The space used by the `binary_search` function is constant.

def longestCommonSubsequence2(arrays: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Finds the longest common subsequence present in the given list of sorted
    arrays.                                    

    The main logic of the function is based on the two-pointer technique used
    in iterating through sorted lists for comparison.
    It iteratively finds the common elements of the first list (starting as
    the common subsequence) and the next ones.
    For each list, it runs through the elements of the current common
    subsequence and the new list side by side.
    If elements don't match, it advances the index of the smaller element.
    Every time a common value is found, it is added to the `new_subsequence`
    that ultimately replaces the current `common_subsequence` list.

    The time complexity of this function is O(n * m), where n is the total
    number of lists, and m is the average size of these lists.
    This is because we are running through each list once, comparing and
    moving the pointers in a linear fashion.
    The space complexity is O(K), where K is the maximum length among the
    input arrays (used to store intermediate subsequences).

#### Understanding the Core Idea {id="core-idea_w1_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

The core idea of this solution is to use a two-pointer technique, similar to merging sorted arrays, to iteratively refine the longest common subsequence (LCS).  It starts by assuming the first array is the initial LCS. Then, for each later array, it compares elements with the current LCS using two pointers, keeping only the elements that match in a new subsequence. This new subsequence then becomes the LCS for the next comparison.

- **Two-Pointer Technique:** This technique enables efficient traversal and comparison of sorted arrays, avoiding nested loops and reducing time complexity.
- **Iterative Refinement:** The LCS is continuously updated, ensuring that only the longest common elements persist across all arrays.
- **Sorted Property:** The algorithm leverages the sorted nature of the arrays, allowing for linear time complexity through pointer advancement based on element comparisons.

---
#### Code Walkthrough  {id="code-walkthrough_w1_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

1.  **Initialization:**
    - `common_subsequences` is initialized with the first array in the `arrays` list, representing the initial LCS.

2.  **Iterative Refinement Loop:**
    - The `for` loop iterates through each array in `arrays` starting from the second array.
    - `new_subsequence` is created to store the potential LCS found in the current iteration.
    - Two pointers, `array_index` (for the current array) and `common_subseq_index` (for the current `common_subsequences`), are initialized to 0.
    - The lengths of the current array and the current `common_subsequences` are stored in `array_length` and `common_subseq_length`, respectively.

3.  **Two-Pointer Comparison:**
    - The `while` loop continues as long as both pointers are within the bounds of their respective lists.
    - The following cases are handled inside the loop:
        - **Match:** If the elements at the current indices match, the element is appended to `new_subsequence`, and both pointers are incremented.
        - **Element in `array` is Smaller:** The `array_index` is incremented to find a potential match further in the array.
        - **Element in `common_subsequences` is Smaller:** The `common_subseq_index` is incremented to find a potential match further in the common subsequence.

4.  **Update and Continue:**
    - After processing an array, `common_subsequences` is updated with `new_subsequence`, which now represents the longest common subsequence found so far.
    - The process repeats for the next array in `arrays`.

5.  **Return Result:**
    - After all arrays are processed, the final `common_subsequences` is returned, representing the longest common subsequence between all the input arrays.

#### Example {id="example_w1_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Input:** `arrays = [[2, 3, 6, 8], [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10], [2, 3, 4, 6, 9]]`

**Step-by-Step Walkthrough:**

1. **Initialization:**

    - `common_subsequences` is initialized with the first array: `[2, 3, 6, 8]`.
    - This represents the initial longest common subsequence (LCS), as it's the only one considered so far.

2. **Main Loop (Iterative Refinement of Common Subsequence):**

    - **Iteration 1:**
        - We compare `common_subsequences` (currently `[2, 3, 6, 8]`) with the second array: `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10]`.
        - Initially, `array_index = 0`, `common_subseq_index = 0`

            - Comparing `2` (from `common_subsequences`) and `1` (from the second array): `1` is smaller, so we move to the next element in the second array (`array_index = 1`).
            - Comparing `2` and `2`: Match found! We add `2` to `new_subsequence` and advance both pointers.
            - Comparing `3` and `3`: Match found! We add `3` to `new_subsequence` and advance both pointers.
            - Comparing `6` and `5`: `5` is smaller, so we move to the next element in the second array.
            - Comparing `6` and `6`: Match found! We add `6` to `new_subsequence` and advance both pointers.
            - Comparing `8` and `7`: `7` is smaller, so we move to the next element in the second array.
            - Comparing `8` and `10`: `8` is smaller, but we've reached the end of `common_subsequences`. The loop terminates.

        - `new_subsequence` is now `[2, 3, 6]`. This becomes the new `common_subsequences` for the next iteration.

    - **Iteration 2:**
        - We compare the updated `common_subsequences` (`[2, 3, 6]`) with the third array: `[2, 3, 4, 6, 9]`.
        - Initially, `array_index = 0`, `common_subseq_index = 0`

            - Comparing `2` and `2`: Match found! We add `2` to `new_subsequence` and advance both pointers.
            - Comparing `3` and `3`: Match found! We add `3` to `new_subsequence` and advance both pointers.
            - Comparing `6` and `4`: `4` is smaller, so we move to the next element in the third array.
            - Comparing `6` and `6`: Match found! We add `6` to `new_subsequence` and advance both pointers.
            - The loop terminates as we reach the end of 'common_subsequences.'

        - `new_subsequence` is now `[2, 3, 6]`. This is the final LCS.

3. **Loop Termination:** The loop terminates after iterating through all arrays in the input.

4. **Iteration Summary:**
    
    | Iteration | Array Compared         | Resulting Common Subsequence |
    |-----------|------------------------|------------------------------|
    | 1         | [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10] | [2, 3, 6]                    |
    | 2         | [2, 3, 4, 6, 9]        | [2, 3, 6]                    |

5. **Result Calculation/Final Steps:**
    - After the loop, the final `common_subsequences` is `[2, 3, 6]`. This is returned as the longest common subsequence across all input arrays.

---
#### Complexity Analysis {id="complexity-analysis_w1_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Time Complexity:**

- $O(n \cdot m)$, where:
    - $n$ is the total number of arrays.
    - $m$ is the average length of the arrays.
- In the worst case, the algorithm might iterate through all elements of each array once for comparison, resulting in linear time complexity with respect to the total number of elements.

**Space Complexity:**

- $O(K)$, where $K$ is the maximum length among the input arrays.
- The algorithm uses a `new_subsequence` list to store the potential LCS in each iteration. The maximum size of this list would be the maximum length among the input arrays. The `common_subsequences` list may also hold up to K elements at any given time.

## Week 2 -> 2083. Substrings That Begin and End With the Same Letter {collapsible="true" default-state="collapsed"}

You are given a **0-indexed** string `s` consisting of only lowercase English letters. Return *the number of **substrings** in* `s` *that begin and end with the **same** character.*

A **substring** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.

**Example 1:**

- **Input:** s = "abcba"
- **Output:** 7
- **Explanation:**
    - The substrings of length 1 that start and end with the same letter are: "a", "b", "c", "b", and "a".
    - The substring of length 3 that starts and ends with the same letter is: "bcb".
    - The substring of length 5 that starts and ends with the same letter is: "abcba".

**Example 2:**

- **Input:** s = "abacad"
- **Output:** 9
- **Explanation:**
    - The substrings of length 1 that start and end with the same letter are: "a", "b", "a", "c", "a", and "d".
    - The substrings of length 3 that start and end with the same letter are: "aba" and "aca".
    - The substring of length 5 that starts and ends with the same letter is: "abaca".

**Example 3:**

- **Input:** s = "a"
- **Output:** 1
- **Explanation:**
    - The substring of length 1 that starts and ends with the same letter is: "a".

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

#### Understanding the Core Idea {id="core-idea_w2_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

The core idea of this solution is to count the occurrences of each unique character in the string and then calculate the number of substrings that can be formed by each character based on its frequency.

- **Frequency Counting:** The code first iterates through the string and counts how many times each character appears using a `defaultdict(int)`. This dictionary automatically initializes new keys (characters) with a default value of 0.
- **Combinatorial Calculation:** For each character, the code calculates the number of substrings it can form. If a character appears `count` times, it can be the start and end of `count` substrings of length 1, `count - 1` substrings of length 2, and so on, down to one substring of length `count`.  This forms an arithmetic series, and the sum of this series is `count * (count + 1) // 2`. This formula derives from n choose 2, which calculates the number of ways to choose 2 items from a set of `n` items; however, usually, n choose 2 is written as $n(n-1)/2$ because we aren't taking into consideration subsets of size 1. That's why we add `n` to the result, making it $n(n+1)/2$.

#### Code Walkthrough {id="code-walkthrough_w2_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

1. **Initialization:**
    - `result` is initialized to 0. This variable will store the total number of substrings.
    - `letter_counts` is a `defaultdict(int)` to store the frequency of each letter.

2. **Counting Letter Occurrences:**
    - The code iterates through each `letter` in the string `s`.
    - For each `letter`, its count in `letter_counts` is incremented by 1.

3. **Calculating Substring Counts:**
    - The code iterates through the `values` (counts) of `letter_counts`.
    - For each `count`, it calculates the number of substrings possible for that letter using `count * (count + 1) // 2` and adds it to the `result`.

4. **Alternative Solution (Commented):**
    - A more concise alternative solution is provided using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module which effectively does the same thing.

5. **Result Calculation/Return:**
    - The final `result`, representing the total number of valid substrings, is returned.

**Input:** s = "abacabd"

**Step-by-Step Walkthrough:**

1. **Initialization:**

    - `letter_counts` is a `defaultdict(int)`, initially empty, designed to store the frequency of each letter encountered.

2. **First Loop (Counting Letters):**
    - **Iteration 1:**
        - The first letter 'a' is processed.
        - The count for 'a' in `letter_counts` becomes 1: `{'a': 1}`.
    - **Iteration 2:**
        - The letter 'b' is processed.
        - The count for 'b' in `letter_counts` becomes 1: `{'a': 1, 'b': 1}`.
    - **Iteration 3:**
        - Another 'a' is encountered.
        - The count for 'a' in `letter_counts` is incremented to 2: `{'a': 2, 'b': 1}`.
    - **Iteration 4:**
        - The letter 'c' is processed.
        - The count for 'c' in `letter_counts` becomes 1: `{'a': 2, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}`.
    - **Iteration 5:**
        - The letter 'a' is encountered again.
        - The count for 'a' in `letter_counts` is incremented to 3: `{'a': 3, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}`.
    - **Iteration 6:**
        - The letter 'b' is processed.
        - The count for 'b' in `letter_counts` becomes 2: `{'a': 3, 'b': 2, 'c': 1}`.
    - **Iteration 7:**
        - The letter 'd' is processed.
        - The count for 'd' in `letter_counts` becomes 1: `{'a': 3, 'b': 2, 'c': 1, 'd': 1}`.

3. **Loop Termination (First Loop):**
    - The loop terminates after processing all seven characters in the string `s`.
    - The final state of `letter_counts` is `{'a': 3, 'b': 2, 'c': 1, 'd': 1}`.

4. **Second Loop (Calculating Substrings):**
    - **Iteration 1:**
        - The first `count` encountered is 3 (the count of 'a').
        - The formula `3 * (3 + 1) // 2 = 6` calculates the number of substrings that can be formed with 'a' as the start and end letter.
        - This value (6) is added to the `result`.
    - **Iteration 2:**
        - The next `count` is 2 (the count of 'b').
        - The formula `2 * (2 + 1) // 2 = 3` calculates the substrings with 'b'.
        - This value (3) is added to the `result`, making it 9.
    - **Iterations 3 and 4:**
        - The remaining counts (1 for 'c' and 1 for 'd') are processed similarly, contributing 1 substring each to the `result`.
        - The formula `1 * (1 + 1) // 2 = 1` is used for these counts, contributing 2 to the `result`.

5. **Result Calculation/Final Steps:**
    - The second loop terminates after processing all counts in `letter_counts`.
    - The final value of `result` (11) represents the total number of substrings in "abacabd" that start and end with the same letter.
    - This result is returned by the function.

#### Complexity Analysis {id="complexity-analysis_w2_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Time Complexity:**

- $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string `s`. This is because the code iterates through the string once to count the character frequencies and then iterates over the dictionary values, which has a maximum size of 26 (for lowercase English letters).

**Space Complexity:**

- $O(1)$. The space used by `letter_counts` is constant, as it stores a maximum of 26 entries for the lowercase English alphabet. Even if the input string is huge, the space usage remains the same.

## Week 3 -> 1580. Put Boxes Into the Warehouse II  {collapsible="true" default-state="collapsed"}

You are given two arrays of positive integers, `boxes` and `warehouse`, representing the heights of some boxes of unit width and the heights of `n` rooms in a warehouse respectively. The warehouse's rooms are labeled from `0` to `n - 1` from left to right where `warehouse[i]` (0-indexed) is the height of the `ith` room.

Boxes are put into the warehouse by the following rules:

- Boxes cannot be stacked.
- You can rearrange the insertion order of the boxes.
- Boxes can be pushed into the warehouse from **either side** (left or right)
- If the height of some room in the warehouse is less than the height of a box, then that box and all other boxes behind it will be stopped before that room.

Return *the maximum number of boxes you can put into the warehouse.*

**Example 1:**

![June2024-week3-ex1.png](june2024-week3-ex1.png)

- **Input:** boxes = [1,2,2,3,4], warehouse = [3,4,1,2]
- **Output:** 4
- **Explanation:**
    ![june2024-week3-ex1-ex.png](june2024-week3-ex1-ex.png)
    - We can store the boxes in the following order:
        1. Put the box of size 1 in room 2 from either the left or right side.
        2. Put a box of size 2 in room 3 from the right side.
        3. Put the box of size 3 in room 1 from the left side.
        4. Put the other box of size 2 in room 0 from the left side.
    - Notice that there are other valid ways to put four boxes such as swapping the boxes of size 2 or boxes of room 0 and 1.

**Example 2:**

![june2024-week3-ex2.png](june2024-week3-ex2.png)

- **Input:** boxes = [3,5,5,2], warehouse = [2,1,3,4,5]
- **Output:** 3
- **Explanation:**
    ![june2024-week3-ex2-ex.png](june2024-week3-ex2-ex.png)
    - It is not possible to put the two boxes of height 5 in the warehouse since there's only one room of height >= 5.
    - We can put the box of size 2 in room 0 from the left side, the box of size 3 in room 3 from the right size and a box of size 5 in room 4 from the right side.
    - Other valid solutions are to put the box of size 3 in room 2 or to put the box of size 2 first in room 2 before putting the rest of the boxes (3 and 5)

**Constraints:**

- `n == warehouse.length`
- `1 <= boxes.length, warehouse.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= boxes[i], warehouse[i] <= 10^9`

### Approach 1: Two Pointer and Greedy Technique {id="approach_w3_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

```Python
def maxBoxesInWarehouse2(boxes: List[int], warehouse: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Determines the maximum number of boxes that can be placed in a warehouse.

    This function implements a two-pointer approach to maximize the number
    of boxes that can fit into the warehouse. It sorts the boxes in descending
    order and attempts to place each box from either the left or right end of
    the warehouse, whichever allows for placement.
    This greedy strategy ensures that larger boxes are given priority,
    maximizing the total number of boxes placed.

    The algorithm maintains two pointers, one at each end of the warehouse.
    For each box, it checks if it can be placed at either end, moving the
    respective point inward if placement is successful.
    This approach efficiently handles the constraint of pushing boxes from
    either side of the warehouse.

    The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n), where `n` is the
    number of boxes, due to the sorting operation. The warehouse traversal
    is linear, but dominated by the sorting complexity.

    The space complexity is O(n) due to the built-in sorting operation
    in Python.
    """
    max_number = 0
    left_index, right_index = 0, len(warehouse) - 1

    for box in sorted(boxes, reverse=True):
        if box <= warehouse[left_index]:
            max_number += 1
            left_index += 1
        elif box <= warehouse[right_index]:
            max_number += 1
            right_index -= 1
        if left_index == right_index:
            return max_number  # Early return if all rooms are checked

    return max_number
