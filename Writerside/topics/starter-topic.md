# Programming Exercises Documentation

Welcome to my Programming Exercises Documentation repository!
This project is dedicated to documenting my journey through various programming challenges,
primarily focused on LeetCode exercises.

## About This Repository

This repository contains detailed solutions and explanations for two types of programming exercises:

1. **Daily Exercises**: These are the daily problems from LeetCode, which are available to all users. 
    They are solved daily.
2. **Weekly Premium Exercises**: These are problems sourced from LeetCode's weekly challenges. 
    They are exclusive to premium members and are solved weekly.

## Repository Structure

- [Daily-Programming-Exercises.md](Daily-Programming-Exercises.md): This file contains links to daily programming
  exercises, also organized chronologically.
- [Weekly-Programming-Exercises.md](Weekly-Programming-Exercises.md): This file contains links to weekly programming
  exercises, organized by year.

Each exercise is thoroughly documented with:

- Multiple approaches to solving the problem
- Detailed explanations of the core ideas behind each approach
- Step-by-step code walkthroughes
- Complexity analysis (time and space)
- Concrete examples to illustrate the solution process

## Features of the Documentation

- **Readable Code**: All functions are written with a focus on readability and maintainability.
- **Comprehensive Docstrings**: Each function is accompanied by a detailed docstring explaining its purpose, and any
  important notes.
- **Multiple Approaches**: Where applicable, different solutions to the same problem are presented, allowing for
  comparison of various techniques.
- **In-depth Analysis**: Each approach is analyzed for its core idea, implementation details, and computational
  complexity.
- **Illustrative Examples**: Step-by-step examples are provided to demonstrate how each solution works with concrete
  inputs.

## How to Use This Repository

You can navigate through the exercises using the links provided in the Weekly and Daily Programming Exercises files.
Each linked document contains detailed solutions and explanations for the respective problems.

Feel free to explore, learn, and use these solutions as a reference to your own programming journey.
If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy coding!
