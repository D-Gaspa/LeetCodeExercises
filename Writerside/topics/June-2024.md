## Week 1 -> 1940. Longest Common Subsequence Between Sorted Arrays {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

Given an array of integer arrays `arrays` where each `arrays[i]` is sorted in **strictly increasing** order, return *an integer array representing the **longest common subsequence** between **all** the arrays*.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Example 1:**

- **Input:** arrays = [[1,3,4], [1,4,7,9]]
- **Output:** [1,4]
- **Explanation:** The longest common subsequence in the two arrays is [1,4].

**Example 2:**

- **Input:** arrays = [[2,3,6,8], [1,2,3,5,6,7,10], [2,3,4,6,9]]
- **Output:** [2,3,6]
- **Explanation:** The longest common subsequence in all three arrays is [2,3,6].

**Example 3:**

- **Input:** arrays = [[1,2,3,4,5], [6,7,8]]
- **Output:** []
- **Explanation:** There is no common subsequence between the two arrays.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= arrays.length <= 100`
- `1 <= arrays[i].length <= 100`
- `1 <= arrays[i][j] <= 100`
- `arrays[i]` is sorted in **strictly increasing** order.

### Approach 1: Binary Search {id="approach-1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

```python
def longestCommonSubsequence1(arrays: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Finds the longest common subsequence present in the given list of
    sorted arrays.

    This function performs a preliminary check to identify the
    smallest array, then checks for numbers in this array across all
    other arrays in the list using a helper binary search function. 

    The time complexity of this solution is O(n * m * log(k)), skewed
    towards the smallest size of the arrays.
    Where n is the number of elements in the smallest array, m is the
    total number of arrays, and k is the average length of the arrays. 

    The space complexity is O(L), where L is the length of the longest
    common subsequence.

    def binary_search(array, num):
        """
        Helper function to perform binary search for 'num' in 'array'.
        """
        index = bisect.bisect_left(array, num)
        # Check if 'num' exists at the insertion point
        if index != len(array) and array[index] == num:
            return True
        else:
            return False

    # Identify the smallest array first
    smallest_array = min(arrays, key=len)
    arrays.remove(smallest_array)

    common_subsequences = []

    for num in smallest_array:
        # Check if 'num' is present in all other arrays
        if all(binary_search(array, num) for array in arrays):
            common_subsequences.append(num)

    return common_subsequences
```

### Understanding the Core Idea {id="core-idea_w1_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

The core idea of this solution is to optimize the search for common elements in multiple sorted arrays by focusing on the smallest array. It leverages binary search to efficiently check if elements from the smallest array exist in all other arrays. This approach reduces the overall search space and time complexity compared to a naive brute-force method.

- **Binary Search:** Utilizes the fact that the arrays are sorted to perform efficient logarithmic-time searches for elements.
- **Smallest Array Focus:** By iterating through the smallest array, we minimize the number of elements that need to be checked across all arrays, leading to a potential performance improvement.
- **Common Subsequence Construction:** An element is added to the longest common subsequence (LCS) only if it's found in all other arrays, ensuring the result is a valid subsequence shared by all.

### Code Walkthrough {id="code-walkthrough_w1_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

1.  **Initialization:**
    - Finds the `smallest_array` using the `min` function with a key based on array length.
    - Removes the `smallest_array` from the `arrays` list to avoid redundant searches.
    - Initializes an empty list `common_subsequences` to store the LCS.

2.  **Helper Function (`binary_search`):**
    - This function takes an array `array` and a target number `num`.
    - It uses `bisect_left` to find the insertion point for `num` in `array` while maintaining sorted order.
    - If `num` is found at the insertion point, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

3.  **Main Loop (Finding Common Elements):**
    - Iterates through each `num` in the `smallest_array`.
    - For each `num`:
        - A generator expression checks if `num` is present in all remaining arrays using `binary_search`.
        - The `all` function checks if all results from the generator are `True`.
        - If `num` is found in all arrays, it's added to `common_subsequences`.

4.  **Return Result:**
    - Returns the `common_subsequences` list, representing the longest common subsequence found.

### Example {id="example_w1_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Input:** `arrays = [[2, 3, 6, 8], [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10], [2, 3, 4, 6, 9]]`

**Step-by-Step Walkthrough:**

1. **Initialization:**
    - The function prints the initial `arrays` input: `[[2, 3, 6, 8], [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10], [2, 3, 4, 6, 9]]`
    - An empty list `common_subsequences` is initialized to store the LCS.

2. **Identifying Smallest Array:**
    - The function identifies `[2, 3, 6, 8]` as the smallest array.
    - This array is removed from the `arrays` list, leaving `[[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10], [2, 3, 4, 6, 9]]`.

3. **Main Loop (Finding Common Elements):** The function iterates through the smallest array, `[2, 3, 6, 8]`.

    - **Iteration 1:**
        - `num` = 2
        - `binary_search` is used to check for the presence of `2` in the remaining arrays:
            - `binary_search([1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10], 2)` returns `True`.
            - `binary_search([2, 3, 4, 6, 9], 2)` returns `True`.
        - Since `2` is found in both remaining arrays, it is added to `common_subsequences`: `[2]`

    - **Iteration 2:**
        - `num` = 3
        - `binary_search([1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10], 3)` returns `True`.
        - `binary_search([2, 3, 4, 6, 9], 3)` returns `True`.
        - '3' is added to `common_subsequences`: `[2, 3]`

    - **Iteration 3:**
        - `num` = 6
        - `binary_search([1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10], 6)` returns `True`.
        - `binary_search([2, 3, 4, 6, 9], 6)` returns `True`.
        - '6' is added to `common_subsequences`: `[2, 3, 6]`

    - **Iteration 4:**
        - `num` = 8
        - `binary_search([1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10], 8)` returns `False`.
        - Since '8' is not found in all arrays, the loop moves to the next iteration without updating `common_subsequences`.

4. **Iteration Summary:**
    ```
        ╒═════════════╤═══════╤═══════════════════════╕
        │   Iteration │   num │ common_subsequences   │
        ╞═════════════╪═══════╪═══════════════════════╡
        │           1 │     2 │ [2]                   │
        ├─────────────┼───────┼───────────────────────┤
        │           2 │     3 │ [2, 3]                │

        ╘═════════════╧═══════╧═══════════════════════╛
    ```

5. **Result Calculation/Final Steps:**
    - The function reaches the end of the loop, and the final `common_subsequences` is `[2, 3, 6]`. This is returned as the longest common subsequence among the input arrays.

### Complexity Analysis {id="complexity-analysis_w1_1" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Time Complexity:**

- $O(n \cdot m \cdot \log(k))$, where:
    - $n$ is the number of elements in the smallest array.
    - $m$ is the total number of arrays.
    - $k$ is the average length of the arrays.

- The nested loops dominate the time complexity. The outer loop iterates through the smallest array (n iterations), and the inner loop implicitly iterates through all remaining arrays (m-1 iterations) within the generator expression. For each element in the smallest array, we perform a binary search in each of the other arrays, with an average time complexity of O(log(k)).

**Space Complexity:**

- $O(L)$, where $L$ is the length of the longest common subsequence.
- The main space usage is due to storing the elements of the LCS in the `common_subsequences` list. The space used by the `binary_search` function is constant.

### Approach 2: Two Pointer Technique {id="approach-2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

```python
def longestCommonSubsequence2(arrays: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Finds the longest common subsequence present in the given list of sorted
    arrays.                                    

    The main logic of the function is based on the two-pointer technique used
    in iterating through sorted lists for comparison.
    It iteratively finds the common elements of the first list (starting as
    the common subsequence) and the next ones.
    For each list, it runs through the elements of the current common
    subsequence and the new list side by side.
    If elements don't match, it advances the index of the smaller element.
    Every time a common value is found, it is added to the `new_subsequence`
    that ultimately replaces the current `common_subsequence` list.

    The time complexity of this function is O(n * m), where n is the total
    number of lists, and m is the average size of these lists.
    This is because we are running through each list once, comparing and
    moving the pointers in a linear fashion.
    The space complexity is O(K), where K is the maximum length among the
    input arrays (used to store intermediate subsequences).
    """
    common_subsequences = arrays[0]

    for array in arrays[1:]:
        new_subsequence = []

        array_index = 0
        common_subseq_index = 0

        array_length = len(array)
        common_subseq_length = len(common_subsequences)

        while (common_subseq_index < common_subseq_length and 
               array_index < array_length):
            if array[array_index] == common_subsequences[common_subseq_index]:
                new_subsequence.append(array[array_index])
                common_subseq_index += 1
                array_index += 1
            elif array[array_index] < common_subsequences[common_subseq_index]:
                array_index += 1
            else:
                common_subseq_index += 1

        common_subsequences = new_subsequence

    return common_subsequences

### Understanding the Core Idea {id="core-idea_w1_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

The core idea of this solution is to use a two-pointer technique, similar to merging sorted arrays, to iteratively refine the longest common subsequence (LCS).  It starts by assuming the first array is the initial LCS. Then, for each later array, it compares elements with the current LCS using two pointers, keeping only the elements that match in a new subsequence. This new subsequence then becomes the LCS for the next comparison.

- **Two-Pointer Technique:** This technique enables efficient traversal and comparison of sorted arrays, avoiding nested loops and reducing time complexity.
- **Iterative Refinement:** The LCS is continuously updated, ensuring that only the longest common elements persist across all arrays.
- **Sorted Property:** The algorithm leverages the sorted nature of the arrays, allowing for linear time complexity through pointer advancement based on element comparisons.

### Code Walkthrough  {id="code-walkthrough_w1_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

1.  **Initialization:**
    - `common_subsequences` is initialized with the first array in the `arrays` list, representing the initial LCS.

2.  **Iterative Refinement Loop:**
    - The `for` loop iterates through each array in `arrays` starting from the second array.
    - `new_subsequence` is created to store the potential LCS found in the current iteration.
    - Two pointers, `array_index` (for the current array) and `common_subseq_index` (for the current `common_subsequences`), are initialized to 0.
    - The lengths of the current array and the current `common_subsequences` are stored in `array_length` and `common_subseq_length`, respectively.

3.  **Two-Pointer Comparison:**
    - The `while` loop continues as long as both pointers are within the bounds of their respective lists.
    - The following cases are handled inside the loop:
        - **Match:** If the elements at the current indices match, the element is appended to `new_subsequence`, and both pointers are incremented.
        - **Element in `array` is Smaller:** The `array_index` is incremented to find a potential match further in the array.
        - **Element in `common_subsequences` is Smaller:** The `common_subseq_index` is incremented to find a potential match further in the common subsequence.

4.  **Update and Continue:**
    - After processing an array, `common_subsequences` is updated with `new_subsequence`, which now represents the longest common subsequence found so far.
    - The process repeats for the next array in `arrays`.

5.  **Return Result:**
    - After all arrays are processed, the final `common_subsequences` is returned, representing the longest common subsequence between all the input arrays.

### Example {id="example_w1_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Input:** `arrays = [[2, 3, 6, 8], [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10], [2, 3, 4, 6, 9]]`

**Step-by-Step Walkthrough:**

1. **Initialization:**

    - `common_subsequences` is initialized with the first array: `[2, 3, 6, 8]`.
    - This represents the initial longest common subsequence (LCS), as it's the only one considered so far.

2. **Main Loop (Iterative Refinement of Common Subsequence):**

    - **Iteration 1:**
        - We compare `common_subsequences` (currently `[2, 3, 6, 8]`) with the second array: `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10]`.
        - Initially, `array_index = 0`, `common_subseq_index = 0`

            - Comparing `2` (from `common_subsequences`) and `1` (from the second array): `1` is smaller, so we move to the next element in the second array (`array_index = 1`).
            - Comparing `2` and `2`: Match found! We add `2` to `new_subsequence` and advance both pointers.
            - Comparing `3` and `3`: Match found! We add `3` to `new_subsequence` and advance both pointers.
            - Comparing `6` and `5`: `5` is smaller, so we move to the next element in the second array.
            - Comparing `6` and `6`: Match found! We add `6` to `new_subsequence` and advance both pointers.
            - Comparing `8` and `7`: `7` is smaller, so we move to the next element in the second array.
            - Comparing `8` and `10`: `8` is smaller, but we've reached the end of `common_subsequences`. The loop terminates.

        - `new_subsequence` is now `[2, 3, 6]`. This becomes the new `common_subsequences` for the next iteration.

    - **Iteration 2:**
        - We compare the updated `common_subsequences` (`[2, 3, 6]`) with the third array: `[2, 3, 4, 6, 9]`.
        - Initially, `array_index = 0`, `common_subseq_index = 0`

            - Comparing `2` and `2`: Match found! We add `2` to `new_subsequence` and advance both pointers.
            - Comparing `3` and `3`: Match found! We add `3` to `new_subsequence` and advance both pointers.
            - Comparing `6` and `4`: `4` is smaller, so we move to the next element in the third array.
            - Comparing `6` and `6`: Match found! We add `6` to `new_subsequence` and advance both pointers.
            - The loop terminates as we reach the end of 'common_subsequences.'

        - `new_subsequence` is now `[2, 3, 6]`. This is the final LCS.

3. **Loop Termination:** The loop terminates after iterating through all arrays in the input.

4. **Iteration Summary:**
    
    | Iteration | Array Compared         | Resulting Common Subsequence |
    |-----------|------------------------|------------------------------|
    | 1         | [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10] | [2, 3, 6]                    |
    | 2         | [2, 3, 4, 6, 9]        | [2, 3, 6]                    |

5. **Result Calculation/Final Steps:**
    - After the loop, the final `common_subsequences` is `[2, 3, 6]`. This is returned as the longest common subsequence across all input arrays.

### Complexity Analysis {id="complexity-analysis_w1_2" collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

**Time Complexity:**

- $O(n \cdot m)$, where:
    - $n$ is the total number of arrays.
    - $m$ is the average length of the arrays.
- In the worst case, the algorithm might iterate through all elements of each array once for comparison, resulting in linear time complexity with respect to the total number of elements.

**Space Complexity:**

- $O(K)$, where $K$ is the maximum length among the input arrays.
- The algorithm uses a `new_subsequence` list to store the potential LCS in each iteration. The maximum size of this list would be the maximum length among the input arrays. The `common_subsequences` list may also hold up to K elements at any given time.
